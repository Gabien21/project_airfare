1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worse flight experience,"Worse experience, they made my last memory of Vietnam sour. I have flown with other budget airlines before so I understand baggage rule can be strict. But they weigh your carry on + personal items (including phone) + had my hoodie in a bag, bottle of water and snacks. They made me weight them and charged 800K dong. I told him I have my jumper, snacks and water and he didn't care and told me to include it on the weigh in. Later I wore my hoodie so it weight less, but my bottle of water and snacks made it go over 7kg. In hindsight I should have just thrown them in the bin. But I was just truly shock, because other budget airline lets you bring food/snacks without including it in the weigh in. It's a money grabbing airline, I understand it's a budget airline. But this is ridiculous. When I asked what my options are, I was told to either buy another plane ticket, check in my bag or pay 800K. I told him I can't check in my carry on because it contains a laptop. He then walked away and told me to not to be difficult. I didn't want to miss my flight because they weight your bags when you are about to board the plane and make you wait until everyone else is on board, so I just paid.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great experience with a local airline…,"Had nothing but a positive experience 

All check in & airside staff were smiley & wholeheartedly over & above customer focused for a (reasonable) budget airline.
Well worth the upgrade to ‘SkyBoss’ status,  for lots of reasons, see below for further details: 

The use of the Vista Lounge at HCMC airport, was well worth it alone, as beside the private bus to the stairs of the plane (domestic terminal, in this instance. Once past security, up one floor & on far left). 

Excellent buffet with ample selection of different dishes, with a compliments, also (hot & cold) drinks. 
With a mix of arm & dining chairs available for your comfort. 

Onboard- If you can really rave about airplane food, possibly the best I’ve had…(pre ordered when booked from UK prior to holiday). 
Clear safety demonstration & all staff very welcoming, well presented, smiley & pleasant throughout. 

A traveller’s tip- if you can do it… go business, premium economy or equivalent when can, when moving about the country… as even though it’s a few pennies more… you get a much smoother passage! 

I would certainly fly this airline again, if need arose.

But our flight from Hue to Hanoi a few days later has a schedule change of over 4 hours. That did not work with our plans, and understanding I would get a refund, I bought a new flight on Vietnam Airlines.

However....the check in process this company uses is archaic and completely inefficient.  We arrived with a 2 hour window, and scarcely made the flight.  The lineup was huge and slow, and when we got to the counter we could see why.  Passports were being checked against ticket bookings character by character.  More than once.   Additionally, after all that, you had to pay for your baggage at the counter, because there was no option to do it online beforehand.

I flew on an empty flight, less than 5% full with plenty of empty rows. But no one on board the flight was allowed to stretch out and be comfortable. Not even a lady with her toddler. Instead they wanted to charge you for the empty seats. Which I don’t have a problem with, but what the staff do is insist you pay cash for it. Which I believe they are pocketing themselves. Because if you want to pay card, they will pull out a menu and show you the card price which is double the cash price. Very dodgy airlines. Extremely bare bones. Everything comes at a cost.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,VietJet Air should be banned!!!,"A Fraudulent Company that should be banned from all airports!!!
We have never in our lives experienced such a terrible airline, I’m shocked how this company is even in operation. Hopefully the authorities will intervene soon so they cannot continue with scamming customers!

The website did not allow us to pay for luggage in advance so we had no choice but to pay extra high charges at the airport. They weighed all our bags and confirmed everything was fine.

The real scam came at the boarding gate, where they decided to re-weigh all our hand baggage and force us to check-in our personal valuables and belongings and pay extortionately higher fees just before we got on the aircraft! They weighed the laptop, carry-on + handbag all together which came to 9kg and they wanted to charge an additional 1200000 Vietnam currency otherwise they would not let us board the plane.

They wasted our time taking so long to weigh the bags and debating over the extra 2 kg. We had to rearrange the baggage to remove the valuables to checkin and pay for hand luggage at the boarding gate….AND THEN THEY DID NOT LET US BOARD THE PLANE!!!!  closing the gate right as it was our turn to get onto the aircraft - NO REFUNDS GIVEN for the excess baggage charges even though they did not let us board the plane!!!! They stated that they closed the gate 2 minutes ago even though we were right in front of it and they could see we’re rearranging our hand luggage as per their instructions.

It truly was a shocking experience! We had to purchase brand new tickets with a different airline to travel to our destination. They charged us excess baggage fees, made us comply with their policies and then closed the gate on us, deliberately making us miss the flight! 

It seemed that the staff enjoy going out of their way to bully and disrupt the comfort of passengers travelling. 

Thankfully we paid for the tickets using a credit card and will have no choice but to claim back through the bank because VietJet certainly do not give any refunds and are simply there to scam you!!!!

First very rude and unprofessional staff at Ahmedabad airport. They asked to weight our purse and jacket which is very unusual and then we missed our flight at Hochi min while coming back. We were at gate 10 sitting and our gate was 14.  We missed the time and no one called our name or bother to find us even it was transit flight. They said it’s silence airport but I have seen other good airlines calling peoples name and waking around if someone has not reported. Your staff did not bother to do that. We paid difference for next day they only ask for cash and never gave us any receipts. You are budget airline but this is way lower quality of handling your customer.

I was charged $70 because my combined carry-on and personal bag exceeded the limit despite my personal bag fitting under the seat and my carry-on does not exceed 14kg. 

Additionally, I encountered several other issues, including unprofessional airport staff, rude security personnel who raised their voices at passengers, and an extremely long check-in line, as there was only one counter available for all Vietjet flights.

This explained the delays because I did not understand how they could keep changing the time and then tell us to go to different boarding points. Once we arrived, the last two of our six bags came out after everyone else had left, and the first thing we noticed was that they were cut open. Upon further inspection at the hotel, I noticed that they cut the bags strategically to fit in small bags as the shape left an imprint on my foam neck rest, which I forgot to take out for the flight.

Afterall, I asked VietJetAir for a refund, but they refused because I couldn't provide the refund form, which I needed to get from their counter at the airport. This is nonsense because I needed to immediately rush to the domestic terminal with a hope of being able to catch my next flight.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Air Hostess Gone Rogue,"As I write this review, my biggest regret is that I did not record my interaction with the air hostess of flight VZ2105 for take-off at 6:35am on Feb. 23, 2025. I had boarded the plane already only to be told by the air hostess that my carry-on was over the allotted size. She made this assessment just by looking at it, though I had already gone through the boarding gate. She stated that I would have to pay ~$63 for the extra luggage. This was for a flight that cost $119 from chiang Mai to Da Nang. Too tired to argue, I agreed to pay but she insisted on cash in thai baht. I told her that I had no thai baht on me but had my cards for payment (having obviously gotten rid of my thai baht since I was leaving Thailand). She refused and I offered to pay in USD, but she mebtioned that they do not accept USD or card payments onboard. Her recommendation was that I go back through immigration to the counter downstairs to pay with my card but that I had only 5 mins, as the plane was about to take off. I was appalled. She continued that if I missed the flight, I would have to catch the next flight, which was ridiculous. The other option she recommended was that I throw one of my bags away. I could not believe this was coming from an air hostess. The other air hosts/hostesses stood around, as if in agreement. She was extremely rude and devoid of empathy - probably my worst encounter in life with an air hostess. She kept counting ""You have 2 mins till we take off"". I was pretty exhausted and asked if there was someone I could speak with. Eventually, someone showed up with a card machine (wow, what a surprise!) and she took the card payment and gave me a receipt. I will like the airline to investigate this issue. As I reflect on this experience, I realize I should have done more. I will be posting this in every customer forum that I can find, and letting everyone I know to avoid this airline!!! As for the air hostess I encountered, you know who you are and what you did.  If you ever get to read this, my question to you is: ""who hurt you? I don't understand how you manage to sleep at night with that attitude.

The worst part of our 2 hour journey was how rude one of the male flight attendants was. We stepped to one side while taking our backpack off to be told in a very sharp manner that it had to go in the overhead compartments which we advised that is what we intended to do.
The same rude flight attendant when we ordered one Coke and a cup of hot water for my herbal tea that he could not/would not let me have a cup of hot water (honestly how much does hot water cost) he then left without giving us the Coke we ordered. I flagged down another attendant who was more helpful and he went and asked for the Coke. I managed to get a cup of hot water by ordering a black coffee bit telling them not to add the coffee 😂.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointing Experience – Look Elsewhere if Possible,"This was the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. I purchased two checked bags (2x20kg), but my baggage situation quickly turned into an unnecessary hassle. My checked bags weighed 15kg and 18kg, leaving me well under my allowance. However, my carry-on was 7.9kg—just 0.9kg over the limit. Instead of allowing me to remove my laptop (which would have brought the weight down to under 6kg), the flight attendant refused to cooperate. Despite having 7kg of unused space in my checked baggage, there was no flexibility.

One male flight attendant suggested I either redistribute my belongings into my checked luggage or pay 1,200 yen per person to increase the carry-on allowance. While this was reasonable, his colleague was completely unhelpful. Instead of working toward a solution, she insisted I check my carry-on bag— which was by far the most expensive option. Since my checked bags were already wrapped, I ended up paying the extra fee. To be clear, the fee itself doesn’t bother me, as I was technically over the limit, but the lack of customer service and common sense was frustrating.

To make matters worse, on this 5.5-hour flight from Tokyo to Hanoi, we weren’t offered any drinks — not even water. They don’t accept card payments, and when I asked for water, I was flat-out refused.

The only redeeming quality? The low price.

HORRIBLE AIRLINE
HORRIBLE AIRLINE. Our flight has been delayed 3 times. We were supposed to leave at 7PM, but delayed thrice and now we're not leaving until 9:30PM. Also, bag drop after online check-in should move quickly, but instead took longer than the regular line. We took two separate flights on VietJet, and found every single person we encountered to be quite unfriendly. On the plane, you pay for everything! They don't even provide a drink! including a drink! We paid $21 for 2 orders of spaghetti, 2 cokes, and a water. And there is a clear bias against American travelers. The flight attendant very politely asked the Vietnamese woman next to us if she would like something to eat or drink, didn't even acknowledge us, and then went across the aisle to the next Vietnamese passenger. We had to flag them down for service. Just ridiculous! If you have other options, I highly recommend pursuing them. This airline is unworthy of your business!

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Worst Airline Experience – Rude Staff, Tiny Seats, and No Professionalism","Over the past two weeks, we have taken six other flights with various airlines, including AirAsia and United, and not a single one came close to the terrible experience we had with VietJet Air.

At baggage check, the agent was not only rude but also handled our belongings carelessly, shoving items back into our bags and even smashing some of our souvenirs. Her bad attitude and complete lack of professionalism made an already frustrating situation worse.

Then, at boarding, the agent scanning passes raised her voice at me just because I expressed frustration with the airline. Instead of handling the situation professionally, she chose to be confrontational, which was completely unnecessary.

To make matters worse, the seats on the plane were incredibly small, with hardly any legroom. It was one of the most uncomfortable flights we’ve ever experienced.

This level of service is a terrible representation of Thai culture and the warmth of its people. Having traveled extensively in Thailand, we know this behavior is not reflective of the country’s hospitality. VietJet Air needs serious improvements in staff training, customer service, and overall passenger experience if they want to meet even basic airline standards.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Unacceptable Delay and Zero Responsibility – Avoid VietJet!,"My husband and I had a terrible experience with VietJet due to their complete lack of responsibility and customer care. Our flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok was delayed, causing us to miss our next flight with another airline. As a result, we lost €120, yet VietJet offered absolutely nothing to help.

The delay was entirely their fault, but instead of assisting passengers who suffered financial losses, they simply ignored the situation. No compensation, no support, even didn't said “sorry”. 
This is the worst kind of airline service—they take your money, waste your time, and leave you to deal with the consequences.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,VIETJET = MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY - SGN AIRPORT – AUSTRALIAN TRAVELLER INFO,"We recently flew with VietJet (VJ) for the first time internationally and domestically in January 2025. Our experience was in line with a lot of the negative comments that have already been posted ie delayed flights etc but there are other things to think about too.

The main consideration regarding whether to use VJ or not depends on your priorities. What is the most important factor - the cost saving or putting up with the annoyances and complications that you are very likely to experience with VJ?

Internationally, we flew SYD-SGN and SGN-SYD which is a peak travelling time in both AU and VN. January coincides with the Australian summer holidays and the lunar new year period which is celebrated by millions of people across Asia. 

The equivalent flights on a full-service carrier eg Vietnam Airlines was nearly AUD 2000 more than VJ for our travelling family of 4 pax. 

So the cost savings for us were considerable - which was a big plus.

However, there are several big negatives. 

Before you get onto a VJ plane, the ‘fun’ begins with the VJ website which seems to have many frustrating glitches – at least in English language mode. If you even manage to successfully check in online, it made no difference at the airport. Everyone was just herded into the same crowded lines waiting to be processed at the understaffed check in counters in SGN / VN. 

Our outbound flight out of SYD on the other hand was nothing out of the ordinary and OK.

Unfortunately, once onboard our experiences with VJ continued downhill. You may need to consider if you can put up with aircraft that are not cleaned or maintained to a better standard. Examples - on boarding the outbound SYD flight, there were a lot of old rice grains from an inflight meal still clearly visible in the middle of the seat and not even removed from the previous incoming flight. 

In the toilets most of the soap dispensers were either broken or 'disabled' and paper towels often ran out which is not ideal for an 8.5 hour flight. First tip – bring your own hand sanitiser as a backup.
Also, inflight cabin and meal services were incredibly slow. Cabin crew attitudes to passengers and their work varied between enthusiastic to at best 'basic/minimal' (the majority unfortunately). 

Tip 2 - pre-order your inflight meal (it tasted better than it looked). It will still potentially take a long time to be served. Keep your boarding pass ready to show to the crew. They need to check it to cross you off their paper list showing who pre-ordered meals when the food trolley rolls along. However, that's better than waiting a further 1-2 hours before the other passengers were even offered a hugely reduced menu ie only instant cup noodles from what we saw.

Our international flights in both directions were delayed by more than 30 minutes. Whilst our short domestic flight from DAD-HAN was delayed by 80 minutes, the inflight experience was acceptable.

Tip – 3 make sure electronic devices are fully charged before getting on your flight. There did not seem to be any power outlets in the armrests. With no back of the seat screens or electronic inflight entertainment options, there are also no power outlets there. 

To be fair, sometimes the delays could have been due to do problems originating in VN and not just VJ doing it for commercial reasons (cancelling to consolidate less full flights). The airports in VN themselves seemed to be constantly dealing with procedural and operational issues leading to late aircraft departure times and then knock on effects. 

The challenges experienced in some VN international airports is worthy of being stand alone topic in itself. 

At SGN International especially, our experience was that it was chaotic and burdened with (overly) bureaucratic procedures. Very long lines for everything seem to be the norm. If you want to save yourself stress, be at the airport no less than 3 hours prior to the scheduled departure time for longer international flights. Whilst our return flight was getting close to Lunar New Year which is extra busy, I was told by an off duty pilot from another airline that this airport chaos was not unusual.

Announcements or info about delays to VJ departing flights was non-existent. At the departure gate, there was also no info on screens or staff present to assist even 15 minutes after the official boarding time. An airport or VJ responsibility or both – who knows? Other airlines showed delayed flight departure info (almost all flights that busy night were delayed between 40 min – 6 hours) on the big info screens – except VJ – just a big blank!?

Also, be aware that checking procedures for carrying water onto aircraft on international flights AFTER the main security screening for the 100ml limit for Liquids, Aerosols and Gels (LAGs), will be applied again at the departure gate for flights back to Australia. 

That is, if you buy any beverages after this airside security screening, you will be asked to surrender them at the departure gate - I’m not sure if this happens to flights going to other countries?  At SGN international airport I could not see any free water bubblers or bottle refillers and tap water is not directly drinkable. 

After we reached cruising altitude, all passengers were given a small 350ml bottle of drinking water at no charge to last the entire 8.5 hour flight. Any additional water/beverages would then need to be purchased inflight. A small bottle of water was priced at VND 50 000. So, Tip 4 - make sure you carry sufficient cash (only?) to maintain basic hydration during the flight as you will have no options when thirsty!

One final gripe is that VJ should consider reviewing their PA system 'entertainment'. 

If the flight is an overnight one leaving and arriving at a destination which for the passengers is biologically at around 4-5am, the practice of blasting ‘happy muzak’ tunes out after landing at what is seemingly the highest volume level possible on the PA system isn't great. For most passengers who have probably had very little/no sleep during the flight, gentler low volume music whilst waiting to deplane would have been more welcoming.

At the end of all this, I think the decision to fly VJ should be made depending on your budget and what you are prepared to put up with. 

In our case, we will not be flying VJ again.",Date of travel: January 2025,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

I am so surprised because I love Vietnam and I love the people however this airline will scam you as much as possible and I believe they know what they’re doing. so first because I was in the line I had to go through security they said that my name was printed differently on my passports my passport says Erik Edward Adofo Mensah, which is my full name unfortunately I did not add the Edward, which I never have added the Edward and that is for at least 26 out of the 27 countries I have visited on this entire planet of earth . they said I need to get out of the security line which I already waited so long and then go back to the ticket counter to have them give me the ticket again. This was after I had to pay a fee of about 150,000 Vietnamese dong then I thought okay but if I come back, can I please go to the VIP line? The security said yes I finally wait in the new line to get my new ticket from the official ticket agent after I paid the fee and guess what? You’re only allowed to bring 7 kg on the plane with you that literally is the same amount as my iPad, and my MacBook combined. so this meant that I had to take everything out of my suitcase and make sure it made it to 7 kg and then go back to the same woman and then pay for the baggage fee which was 350,000 Vietnamese dong and then wait in line again in order to get now my bag checked to finally make it through the line to get the security. i’ll ask the woman where on the website in Vietnamese or an English does it say this and after scrolling for about a good five minutes she finally showed me where it was in a tiny print. Halfway down the page and I believe the idea is that you miss your flight and then you have to book another flight again and this is how this airline makes money. do not fly this airline pay the extra amount and fly any other airline at this point.  I will just take the loss because it’s the principle of the matter. I’m happy to pay fees if I notified about it but when you do this when I’m about to board the flight and it feels like a scam it just isn’t nice and it’s not necessary .I will try to report it to my bank that it is a scam because what I paid for and what I was offered was not delivered and I will forever stop taking any budget airline, dishonesty is not sexy i also noticed they had it placed on the information desk as if this kind of problem happens so much.

We flew 3 domestic flights in Vietnam with vietjet and then an international flight back to Australia during our SEA holiday. The domestic flights were inexcusably cramped, and invariably delayed, by multiple hours in some cases. The seats feel specifically designed to inflict as much discomfort as possible. For 2 of our flights the planes made this constant barking sound, as though there was a distressed dog under the floor. I actually assumed that's what it was the first time, the second occurrence suggests it was the plane itself.

The international flight was on time to depart but we then sat on the tarmac for 50 min waiting for a terminal at the destination, this probably isn't the fault of the airline but it's hard to ignore this mob have significant delays every time we fly. You're not allowed to take your own water on the plane, but have to pay the equivalent of $4.5 for a pathetic little 350ml bottle during the flight. I needed 4 over my 8 hour flight.

There is no inflight entertainment, no power outlet of any kind. I know it's a budget airline but this is 2025.

Some of the cabin crew couldn't have been any more unhappy to be there either, clearly the customers aren't the only ones struggling with the experience.

My tour operator in Hanoi then organised flights for me, but the conversion from Aud to VD, plus 13 separate fees and taxes bumped up the price considerably. In hindsight I should have booked through a travel agent. The flight was delayed a couple of times out of Sydney by 4+ hours as it was late from Hanoi. The return flight was also delayed around 4+ hours too.  On a positive, the flight attendants were very sweet and attentive.  There was a passenger across the aisle from me in first row business who had her two young daughters sitting in economy.  As she had a spare seat beside her, the children came down to business and the three of them shared the 2 seats. The girls did go back to economy for landing.  My so called direct flights became very long and tiring due to long delays.  Next time it would be better to book premium economy on Vietnam Airlines, so I would give Vietjet a miss. I may not have a choice but to use them domestically though whilst in Vietnam on my next trip.",Date of travel: January 2025,

You airlines has continued pissing me off for another day in your country.

VietJet Air do you have any support in place??
you keep changing flights, schedules, there’s no logical gap between the connecting flights and then you harrass people to pay for priority checkin by charging a bomb?

One measly bottle of water for a 10-hour flight, and if you dare to want more, you’ll need to pay. I asked for warm water to take medication, and while the staff wasn’t outright rude, they certainly weren’t friendly—no smiles, no kindness, just blank indifference, as if passengers were a burden.

There wasn’t even a screen to show basic flight information like remaining travel time—let alone entertainment or phone chargers. My child, who had a fever, needed a blanket. When I requested one, the flight attendant responded with, “I’ll check if we have any,” as though it were an item of rare luxury. Unsurprisingly, nothing was brought, not even the courtesy of a follow-up to confirm whether they had blankets or not.

The entire experience was devoid of care, comfort, or quality. And for what? The ticket wasn’t even cheap. This airline operates with an astonishing lack of basic decency or service.

Travelled from Brisbane to Mumbai via Saigon (Ho Chi Minh) on 3rd Jan with return on 22nd Jan with family (Me, wife & a 10yo). I mainly booked Vietjet as we were a bit late in deciding our holidays this time around but after the experience, I am not going to be consider this airline again.

Summary of issues:
1) Lacks basic etiquettes and amenities - No blankets are provided for overnight flights, No USB chargers in planes and even at Saigon airport which seems to be a setback in time. We were not expecting food, screens and drinks obviously but for a 7-8 hr overnight flight, you expect a bit more.

2) ICE COLD aircon - with no passenger controls. All flights in all sectors had an aircon temperature of 10-12 degrees I think with air flow right in your face. Not one flight had the overhead flow control. By the time we got off each flight, you would hear people coughing and sneezing all around including us. No blankets are provided even for overnight >7 hr flights.

3) Tickets are not as cheap as they are made out to be. We didn't have an option with Malaysian, Singapore or Indigo/Qantas and hence the compulsion. It cost us approx $3600 for all 3 of us incl luggage.

4) Waiting facilities are not upto the standard.

5) Food is good at Saigon airport and in flight but for some reason staff only ask for cash. Cards dont work - which is strange.

Vietjet is the *worst airline* in this entire universe. I booked a ticket for my mother from Brisbane to Cochin via Saigon, with a same-day connecting flight. The reference number is *6CGRH2*, Cicily Jose. They cancelled the flight just before the gate opening time and didn’t arrange any alternative travel or accommodation for any of the passengers. After a few hours, they rescheduled the flight for the next day, but then postponed it again and again, eventually delaying the trip for *five days* after *rescheduling it for five times.*
We requested to cancel the trip, but they said we would still be charged for the connecting flight, as it took off on time. What a joke! They refuse to consider the fact that she missed the connecting flight due to their own mistake. That’s fine—we reluctantly agreed to their unfair terms. We then requested a refund for at least half of the money, but now comes the true nature of this airline: they never refunded the amount, despite *at least 100 calls* to their customer care and numerous emails.
It’s been over three months, and I’ve called their call center in Vietnam, where I’ve spoken with a bunch of *unprofessional, inefficient customer care agents*. I can assure you they are *deliberately withholding refunds* to make extra income.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,The budget airline that could make you feel you’re cheap.,"First of all, I just want to be clear that I have no intention to defame a brand of targeting any individual, barely my experience with the airline and hope someone will find it helpful. 

On my way back to Melbourne from Saigon. I paid for a selected seat right after the Business Class. Over halfway through the flight I decided to use the bathroom and I was carefully checking that its available and was refused with “Use the back, sir, use the back”, no information or explanation given. The funny thing is that 2 other caucasian families sitting right in front of me & some other passengers have been using that same bathroom the whole flight. 

I really dont mind walking all the way to the back of the plane where there are people waiting, but I just don’t know what did I do wrong there. I’ve been very polite to the crew and people besides me the whole flight.

Prior to this experience, there were 2 security personnels at the boarding gate acting like thugs touching people bags without consent to make sure no water bottles pass on the plane. I hope this is purely just for security reason rather than the fact that the airline sales tiny bottles of water for $3 during flight.

I think I should also mentioned that my flight from Melbourne to Saigon on the 22nd Dec was delayed from 1am to 10am with 24hours notice and luckily I got $18 voucher compensation from them.

Spent ~$2400 for return flights which is a lot to me but it seems like I should have done better. Feeling a bit cheap of myself.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst and Most Emotional Travel Experience Ever,"VietJet has been the most unprofessional and customer-insensitive airline I’ve ever dealt with. My journey from Bali to Mumbai, with a layover in Vietnam, was a complete nightmare.

The first flight was delayed by an hour, which was manageable. However, the second leg of the journey faced an 8+ hour delay, and the airline handled it terribly. They provided updates sporadically (roughly once an hour) rather than informing passengers from the start. This left everyone stranded at the airport with no food, water, or accommodation. When passengers understandably began expressing their frustrations, instead of offering solutions, the airline called airport security to ‘handle’ complaints.

Another 8-hour delay on the way back home, leading to an 18-hour layover for the connecting flight. This wasted two days of our trip and resulted in significant financial losses. VietJet showed no regard for their passengers’ time or money.

To make matters worse, attempts to contact their customer service for a refund were fruitless. After explaining our situation, they asked us to wait for approval but never followed up—just like they handled updates during the delays. We never heard back from them.

Even the most basic human essential—water—was not provided on all flights. This speaks volumes about how little they care for their passengers’ well-being.

VietJet is an excuse of a company with no concern for its customers. I strongly advise against flying with them, especially if you value your time, money, or basic dignity.",Date of travel: January 2025,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the exceptional ground staff at Vietjet Air who went above and beyond to assist my family during a recent journey to South Korea. We encountered a stressful situation with passport and visa issues that could have jeopardized our trip. However, the dedication and professionalism of the ground staff - Mentioning Mr. Parth Shah, Mr. Pradip and Mr. Ankush, turned what could have been a nightmare into a smooth and memorable experience.

Their empathy, quick thinking, and resourcefulness were remarkable. It was evident that they genuinely cared about helping us reach our destination, even when it meant going beyond their usual responsibilities. Thanks to their extraordinary support, we were able to board our flight and enjoy our long-awaited Christmas trip to South Korea.

Vietjet Air, you have an outstanding team, and we will always remember their kindness and professionalism. Thank you for making customer service truly exceptional!

Mr. Parth specifically showed his dedication and smart thinking while connecting the designated immigration authorities in South Korea and getting us a quick revert even though it was midnight at Seoul. We are immensely thankful to the team and would love to fly again and again, as we are frequent travelers in your airline.

We were a group of 4 and I pointed out she had labelled my brothers bag as mine, she said it doesn't matter as we are a group. Yet we all know the ""Did you pack your bag yourself?"" question. Okay so I know he didn't have any thing he should not have in his bag but if customs stopped me and he did, could I blame the airline for mislabelling my bag? I doubt it! If in a group ALWAYS check they have labelled your bag as yours if you're not sure what others are carrying. All 4 bags were labelled wrongly in our case. We were then delayed by a further hour (totalling 3). No update from Vietjet and as we had a very limited time in Vietnam this was annoying. Would not have been so bad if it was communicated to us. When we could finally board i asked about compensation and was told I was not entitled to anything, I referred them to their own webpage which mentions 400,000vnd. I was reluctantly given a meal voucher for 23,000vnd. This would only get me a bottle of water. They reluctantly handed this out to another man who overheard my conversation but did not offer other customers. The flight itself was okay. It actually took off 4 hours late in the end, our arrival time of 2035hrs was then 0030hrs. We were all fed up and exhausted and there was no apology from staff on board or even pilot announcement. No offer of any free snack or drink on board. Second time flying with this awful airline and wound NEVER use again. Only used a second time as had pre booked.

After being in the que for about 35 minutes it was finally our turn and the ground steward said we couldn’t checkin yet because it’s not open for our flight yet and we have to que up again in an hour. 

I told her we were send by her colleague, she called them and they acted like that didn’t happen and I was lying.

1. Every single flight is delayed, often by several hours.

2. I rescheduled my ticket for an 11PM flight to one departing at 8:40PM. Now it turns out that this flight will be delayed to at least 9:40PM (and possibly even later).

3. Unlike other airlines, they will charge you for a name change (and waste your time, cause unnecessary stress, etc) if your middle name is missing from the ticket.

4. They will even weigh your hand luggage and if it's even slightly more than the 7kg limit, they will try to charge you extra.

Basically, the ""cheap"" tickets are a false economy: they will cause a lot of unnecessary stress and you'll end up paying as much as the other airlines anyway.

This led to our Vietnam visa expiring. Eventually when we did get to Saigon, this dump of an airline gave us a 40 HOUR LAYOVER, gave us 8 vouchers for BASIC FOOD AND SHELTER (one voucher got you only an hour of sleep), and demanded us to pay $10 for each voucher. Furthermore, the staff at the transfer desk (which we needed to go to get our next boarding passes) were so rude and demanded to see every passport I had from when I was born just to give me my boarding pass. After that extremely tiring odyssey, when my boarding pass was ready, they just refused to give me it without any reason. I eventually persuaded them to give it to me. The 40 hours of layover was practically torture. By the end we looked like inmates! Eventually, when the SGN-DEL flight was finally near, it was delayed by another 5 hours.

Despite paying for overweight baggage (7 kilograms over the limit, which is typical for this airline), I was unreasonably required to shift 2 kilograms from my carry-on to my checked luggage. Despite me begging that I was having a leg injury, the staff strictly required me to do so. Due to my injury, I requested assistance in retrieving my heavy checked bag from the baggage belt. The staff member offered minimal help, moving the bag only a short distance.

Further, the wheelchair policy is very inconvenient. I checked in almost 4 hours prior to my flight and requested wheelchair assistance for boarding. The airline's policy required me to remain in my check-in position until departure. The staff's initial explanation was unclear, leading me to believe I would need to re-check-in entirely upon returning for boarding, rather than  re-register for wheelchair assistance only. This inflexible policy for passengers with disabilities is unacceptable.

After checking in our luggage, my family tried to make the most of it by watching a movie at a nearby mall (Menas mall) and we left to go back to the airport around 20:00. We were waiting in the line to board when we got told that it was delayed to 22:10 which is ridiculous. After this we stood in the line to board and they made us wait for the bus for 10+ minutes. Even though we were one of the first people in the line somehow we ended up getting on the bus last because they made the people after us get on first. Also another lovely note, there were cockroaches on the bus and the driver almost crashed into another bus. We only arrived at our hotel around 1 am and we had to inconvenience the hotel staff by checking in late and making them pick us up late. On top of that our entire day was basically wasted because of traveling. Don’t book with this airline. You will spend hours waiting and it’s exhausting. I’ve been on multiple different flights this year and none were as unorganized and unpleasant as the ones with this airline. Obviously no issues with the actual flight attendants and the actual flight. It’s more the scheduling and how disruptive it is to a schedule",Date of travel: December 2024,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Surprisingly decent! (If you aren't in a rush),"Review for Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi
I booked my flight from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi a few months in advance. I changed the day of one flight a day earlier to make a tour and it was handled smoothly through chat on the vietjet website with a small change fee because of my ticket type. A month before my flight, I recieved a notification that my original flight time of 6.30am was moved to 7.00am which was fine for me.

A week before my flight I went into my booking to add checked luggage and a seat which was easy. My original ticket only included hand luggage and I decided I needed more. Price of the 20kg luggage add on was priced under 9 USD and a seat cost me under $2 USD. A day before I used the online check in which took a couple minutes.

My flight was scheduled to leave Ho Chi Minh at 7.00am. I arrived at the airport at 5.15am in case of any long lines and I had my ticket and luggage dropped off by 5.20am with a tiny line. Many counters were open so it was quick. They weighed my luggage and nothing was overweight so no issues and my ticket name was fine. It took me under 10 minutes to pass through security and arrive at my gate. My full drink bottle was fine to take through too.

Several food options at the airport which are reasonably priced for a tourist but would be double a local restaurant. A bowl of pho is 130 to 150k for example. There is a banh mi shop, drink shop and some other small food places around. A small bottle of water was around 20 to 25k. Waiting seats were comfortable and easy to find one available throughout my hour waiting. We were all in one large hall with many vietjet gates going to all the domestic destinations.

My ticket mentioned boarding was at 6.30am. They called us to line up around 6.10am and we started to board the bus around 6.15am. They started early as it took at least a few buses to get all the passengers to the plane. The first bus I was on left was at 6.23am and I was on my seat at 6.30am. All passengers settled by 6.50am. 

Plane doors closed at 7am and safety explanations and a bit more waiting. Plane started to move at 7.15am and took off close to 7.30am. Seat was comfortable with a generous recline but the leg room space was limited.
The pilot made some time up in the air so we touched down at 9.12am only a couple minutes after the scheduled 9.10am. I reached the baggage belt at 9.25am.

Review for to Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh
Similar to above although after checking in, but I was notified that my flight was delayed by 2 hours so I had a lot of time at the airport. A basic beef pho cost be 89k and there were more expensive options over 100k. By the time the plane took off, we were around 3 hours behind schedule and landed 2.5 hours after the original schedule.

Overall decent flights if you aren't in a rush so I would recommend to allow a few hours buffer.",Date of travel: December 2024,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

They delayed the flight 3 times in a day, delayed approxed 20 hours. If you are planning to travel with VietJet, be prepared to be delayed 1-2 days. If you have something urgent, which required your presence in VietNam, it will be 100% safe to book with another airline, will cost you ""estimated longer travelling time"", but end up in VietNam before VietJet.

When I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant if the first row was full. She said, ""You can sit there."" The row was empty! Besides exit rows, it's the only row with extra legroom. So how is it that the manager couldn't see that on her computer?

They said the flight would be delayed to 4.30pm. With every hour passed, the flight got pushed back another hour. At 7.30pm, mind you 5hours of waiting, they said the flight will not happen and instead of reimbursing you with compensation fee for another flight, they pay for a free hotel stay. The hotel stay was nice, but I seriously just want to fly out of the country as I have to meet someone on a tight schedule. Checked on their website that compensation fee was only a $100. How can i pay for a next day flight at $800 with the amount? We were told that our flight will be at 1pm the next day but this morning when I checked out, they said the flight is pushed back to 3.30pm instead AGAIN. How many more delays after delays do we need to endure again? Can’t they just send another plane immediately to resolve this issue? Or pay us our flight from another airline.

Once I checked in VietJet Air counter at Narita, the games began again claiming my carry-on bag was 8kg, which was 1 kg over the allowed 7kg. No big deal, right? Nope, even after I took some items out of my carry-on to lessen the weight by putting some items in my check-in, they claimed I was still over 7kg by 0.3 kg. You can''t make this stuff up. So I tell them I can either put my cell phone in my check-in which has a battery in the phone or my portable power bank, which is also a battery which is not supposed to be in check-in. I told them it is a danger hazard and against all airlines flight policy. Nevertheless, I paid the extra extorted 2000 Yen ($13 USD) just to be done with it.

New arrival time 6:40 a.m. The lady gave me my boarding pass and she said pls you can proceed to gate ___ so you can get free food and drinks. A compensation for the delay. 
Note: you are not allowed to bring water in the plane. So be aware that you don’t spend money on water. Finally, got in the plane i was so shocked that there was no screen for movies. All you do it sit and nothing.  I have sensitive nose and i can smell pee on the carpet. Note as well that you need to purchase your own meal prior the flight. I thought the meal was included but it wasn’t. The sit wasn’t comfortable. I don’t have an issue with the flight attendant they are actually attentive to the passengers. Overall for my experience, the airline has a problem itself, I think this is an eye opener for everyone. Never settle for less. 
To Viet jet, I would say thank you for flying people safely, especially to the captains. You are a legend. The flight attendants who were there to assist passengers. 
Viet jet it is time for you to take action on the matter. Be sensitive enough of the feelings of the passengers.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Vietjet Air. Just money hungry, greedy trickster. Taking advantage of helpless pax transiting in Saigon Airport.","Vietjet treat their customers like garbage. They engage in a price gouging scam in conjunction with the Vietnamese Customs. They will fly you to Ho Chi Minh (SGN) but if you have to transit with another airline, the Saigon Ground Service will not help you at the transit desk even if they are supposed to. Basically, you are trapped because you cannot leave airside because to do so, you would have needed to apply for a tourist visa three days before you arrive and there's no visa on arrival approvals even though they have the form for you to fill out and have the money to pay for it. 

The Saigon Ground Service will tell you you have to go outside of Customs to Landside to check in even thoufh you are transiting. If you do not have a passport allowing you visa free access, you cannot leave the airport to get your boarding pass for the next leg of yur journey. The Saigon Ground Service is in on it too with Vietjet because they will not help you check in even though they are affliated with your airline nor help you print a boarding pass. Then you're left to the Customs to deport you or you are given the only option to buy another airline ticket from you know who? Vietjet Air. 

They will say we will ""support"" you to get you where you need, you just need to buy a ticket from them. So, 1. You've lost money from being unable to use your connecting ticket. 2. You're out of pocket because you have to buy another connecting flight with Vietjet Air. Kaching and pay day for Vietjet. Every airline sales rep can do with more commissions in their pay check 3. You cop the abuse and left to whim of the angry Vietjet Air ticket sales lady in the transit area. If you say no, she will follow you around the airport until you buy a ticket from her to get the commission.

Pictures of the perpetrator is enclosed for your reference. Here, you can see she is being abusive and aggressive to a young Indian student who cannot transit on your flight. She was fooled into believing that the Vietjet lady was going to help her. Such naivety sill hurt her dearly. Obviously, she doesn't really have money to buy a Vietjet connecting flight ticket but the Vietjet Sales Lady cannot tolerate that, she needs to pry her purse open and that of her family's to get her commission.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Thinking about flying to Vietnam?,"My experience with Vietjet Air has been one of the worst I’ve had with an airline.

I planned to visit my family over the holidays with my brother in Delhi and we decided to have a holiday in Vietnam beforehand. We were very excited to travel together and explore Vietnam.  However, due to significant and multiple schedule changes entirely caused by the airline, one of the tickets in my booking (T6GVV6) became unusable. This affected all our accommodation bookings and made us feel very uncertain about our itinerary and travel plans. It was our first time travelling on our own and the last things you need is an unreliable airline. 
 
Despite their own policies stating that refunds or credit shells are available for significant disruptions, my refund request was denied without any proper explanation.

Communication with Vietjet has been abysmal. Repeated attempts to contact them resulted in vague responses, delays, and no resolution. Their lack of transparency, unwillingness to take responsibility, and failure to adhere to their own policies have caused unnecessary stress and financial loss.

This level of customer service is unacceptable. If you’re considering flying with Vietjet, be prepared for a complete lack of support if something goes wrong.",Date of travel: October 2024,

3.0 of 5 bubbles,It's Different,"We chose Vietjet for our internal Flights as they were well priced with the Deluxe fare including 20kg of Hold luggage and 7kg carry on was less than half the price of flights with Vietnam Airlines . Prior to us travelling they did change our flight to another aircraft which changed it from and Airbus A321 to an Airbus A330 . It was 30 minutes later which for us was not an issue . We made the Change with our Hotel pick up without any dramas .
Check in was smooth as we had checked our Case weights on the Scales at the Ibis Hotel so check in was easy . They are extremely hot on any over weight luggage which would be quite expensive . After check in we were asked to wait to on side of the Counter . No knowing why we had to wait we waited for 10 minutes or so and asked one of the staff why are we waiting . They informed me that we have to wait until our checked bags have gone through Security clearance , which they had so we were clear to go through security , more queues , passport examined 3 more times , this is a Domestic flight . We were  finally were Airside . We had plenty of time so found our gate and decide to have a Beer at one of the few food outlets . They are nothing like Food outlets in Australian Airports , you are charged fair prices . A beer was around $1:80 . A bottle of water was 60 cents  .
Soon it was time to board . we joined one of the 2 queues that had formed and it didn't take to long to be out on the Tarmac waiting to board a Bus to take us to the Plane . It is not that they don't have boarding gates with proper Airbridges but that they don't use them . The vast majority of Airlines use this Method of embarking and disembarking . Not very efficient . We eventually got to our plane and found our seat .Vietjet play a boarding song on all their Aircraft . Which is ok for around 5 minutes but which will drive you round the bend eventually , it is so annoying . Bring Earplugs . 
The Boarding process is very chaotic and delays are very common . We eventually departed 30 minutes Late although Boarding began 5 minutes earlier than advised . We were advised the flight time was 2 hours 20 minutes but we landed spot on time .
Well done Pilot . 
The Seats were ok for economy , with decent leg room , pretty standard for Budget Airlines . The Flight was pretty full .
On Arrival in Hanoi we had a short wait for Buses and everyone is brought to the one entry into the Terminal so the Chaos resumes . We had quite a wait for our Luggage but it eventually arrived . We survived our first VietJet Flight .

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Avoid This Airline,"VietJet Airline offers a terrible experience for customers. My cabin bag was overweight by just 1.7 kg, and they forced me to buy 20 kg of luggage allowance. Despite this unreasonable demand, I complied without any hesitation or argument. However, when I went to check in, the counter staff claimed there was an issue with my name. I have traveled to many countries with this same name and have never encountered such a problem before.

When I attempted to resolve the issue, they asked me to pay 500,000 VND to change my name. I explained that there was no error in my first or last name, and their system clearly recognized my details since I was able to print my boarding pass from the machine. If their system couldn’t accept my name, how was I able to do that?

I told the staff that if I had to pay this unjust fee, I would not board the flight because I had done nothing wrong. The staff, without any empathy, simply said it was up to me but that I wouldn’t be allowed to board without paying. The flight ticket itself was just around 1 million VND, but I was already charged 1.5 million VND for 20 kg of luggage and now had to pay an additional 500,000 VND for the name change. In total, they demanded 2 million VND more than I originally paid.

Is this fair to customers? I ended up canceling my entire trip. This experience clearly shows how unprofessional and unsympathetic VietJet Airline is toward its passengers. I strongly advise against using this airline.",Date of travel: November 2024,

They argued that other airlines would do so same. I flew Vietnam Airlines intra-vietnamese and T'Way Air internationally out of Vietnam and had no problem with limiting my name to first given and family name.

At check-in, I was told that I couldn’t enter Bangkok because I had fewer than two blank pages in my passport for stamps. As a result, I had to cancel my flight and spend an entire day scrambling to obtain an emergency passport, all for an important meeting in Bangkok.

To add insult to injury, when I finally arrived in Bangkok, the immigration officials confirmed that Vietjet's information was incorrect. This misinformation caused me unnecessary stress, a wasted day, and significant financial loss—over a million Dong to change my flight and $150 USD to secure a new visa to re-enter Vietnam, since my multiple entries were on my original passport.

This experience has left me extremely frustrated and disappointed. I urge Vietjet Air to improve their training and communication to prevent such issues from happening in the future.

My wife and I anticipated a smooth journey with VietJet Air on flight VJ884 from Mumbai to Ho Chi Minh City. However, our experience took an unexpected turn due to limited communication and logistical issues.

We checked in online, printed our boarding passes on October 24, and arrived on time at the airport the following day. After passing security and immigration checks, we waited at the gate, only to be informed by ground staff that our seats had been canceled due to a last-minute change to a smaller aircraft. The announcement came without prior notice and impacted many passengers. Despite this, we observed other passengers boarding as usual, leading us to question the extent of the seat cancellations.

When we inquired about possible solutions, we were advised to stay calm, with staff subtly hinting at involving airport security if we pressed further. This response left us feeling disregarded rather than reassured.

In the end, we, along with three other passengers, were escorted to immigration, where we spent over two hours obtaining a “cancellation” stamp and completing forms for refunds. The paperwork cited “overbooking” as the reason, which was a shift from the initial explanation of a “technical issue.” Each of us received $80 in compensation, which did not cover our non-refundable expenses, including hotel bookings, a river tour, and a restaurant reservation.

Based on this experience, we would advise travelers who prioritize consistent communication and reliability to consider alternative airlines.",Date of travel: October 2024,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

1.0 of 5 bubbles,VietJet Air truly sucks!,"I travel for work weekly and quite often for leisure as it is one of my passions and I must say that this is the worst Airline and customer service there is. 

Quality and customer service are a foreign language to these folks. They simply understand none of it. 

There was a spelling mistake on my name that wasn’t caught on the initial checkup.  That’s understandable, as we all make mistakes. When it’s time to board they won’t let me and my wife board due to this mistake. Resolving this issue would cost 1,500 ¥ cash the person on the counter stated. They would not process a credit or debit card transaction, Apple Pay or anything of the sort. Had to be cash! 

I give her a 5,000 ¥ bill and they can’t accept it because they do not have any change. I must add that by this time boarding is about to end. The spelling mistake was a  “Z” on my first name when it was supposed to be an “S”. 

I told her not to worry about the change that she can keep the 5,000 ¥, again cash, but that I needed to leave Japan for my other vacation destination. We were the last to board because of this and as a result no space for carry-on.

1. After going through all security checks at Tan Son Nhat International Airport when we  got to the gate , security have an additional barrier for the flight to Perth and you have to empty all water. I have never seen this before.
	2.	You are then crammed onto buses to be taken to remote part of airport to board plane using stairs. I presume this is to save money by not using an aerobridge.
	3.	After being required to dispose of all of your water we then  asked for water on plane but the attendant advised you can only buy water as none is provided. Again I have never heard of an airline not providing water particularly on an international flight!
	4.	When paying for the water you have to use Vietnamese Dang as they have no eftpos facility on the plane. Fortunately we had enough Dang left to buy water as we had not anticipated that there would be no eftpos facility.
	5.	There is no on board entertainment system, not even a USB point to charge your device.
	6.	Food has to be prepurchased or you can see what is left and buy that if you have kept enought Dang but if you haven’t kept enough Vietnamese money then you are out of luck! To be honest the purchased food looked terrible and the person in front of me was offering hers to anyone interested.
	7.	There are no pillows or blankets which before this flight I thought was standard on international flights.
	8.	We were travelling to Adelaide on the same plane after what they call a technical stop in Perth. Again information is minimal and the few English speaking passengers were confused as to whether they had to disembark the plane as it was only on the ground for an hour. I assumed you had to exit the plane but double checked with one of the attendants and then let other Enlish speaking people know.
	9.	Seats are very close to each other and they are not well cushioned and extremely uncomfortable.

After booking an early morning flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City with a long layover for my international connection to Mumbai, VietJet rescheduled my flight to 10 hours later, then it got delayed further. I was then put onto a third flight another hour later.

Despite raising concerns about missing my connecting flight, I was reassured by their staff that everything would be handled including a potential overnight layover in HCMC if I didn't make it in time.

When I landed n HCMC, I had just 30 minutes left to clear immigration and security and get to the gate for my connection, which is impossible at Ho Chi Minh City airport! I missed my flight, of course, and spent 24 hours stranded in a new city and received zero support or accommodation.

The rude Vietjet staff at HCMC then argued with me, demanding I pay a change fee.  No options. Only after I escalated this to their social media team was this fee dropped. 

To make matters worse, VietJet blamed me for ""showing up late"", even though their delays caused the entire issue and I was on time/early whenever it was humanly possible. No proof or logical reasoning provided. Just denial.

I recently flew with VietJet in Business Class and was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. As a low-cost carrier, I didn’t expect luxury, but the flight exceeded my expectations in many ways. While there’s no in-flight entertainment, which I found perfectly fine as I prefer reading, the service and comfort made up for it.

The outbound flight was a night flight, and I was impressed by the fantastic red wine and the great meal options. The food was surprisingly delicious for a budget airline, with a range of tasty choices that made the flight more enjoyable. The beautiful and attentive staff added a personal touch, always friendly and quick to assist.

Additionally, the luggage service was fast, and I appreciated how smoothly everything went both during boarding and after landing.

Unfortunately, we encountered a particularly rude male flight attendant. When my mother asked him for water upon boarding, he curtly informed her that it would be served later with the meals.

About half an hour later, when the meals began arriving, we received one bottle of water each. My mother requested an extra bottle, which the female flight attendant provided. Shockingly, the male attendant then demanded the extra bottle back, snatching it from my mother’s hand. This behavior was both unprofessional and disrespectful.

Additionally, I found it bizarre that they required a boarding pass from each passenger before serving meals. My boarding pass was in my bag, and I had to retrieve it, which I’ve never experienced in my many travels.

This encounter left a very negative impression of Vietnamese hospitality. Such behavior is not fitting for the airline industry and reflects poorly on the country. If anyone had a similar experience, I’d like to hear how you would react if someone snatched a bottle of water from your mother.

I didn’t catch the name of the attendant, but I would recognize him if I saw his picture in the future. VietJet can easily identify him based on the flight details.

I will not fly with VietJet again and will strongly advise others to be cautious as well.",Date of travel: September 2024,

I have attached the booking details with all the information detailing what we have paid for.
We both paid for E sims for our departure flight and for our return flight (VJ997), we did not receive any information or emails with a QR code for us to be able to use the E sims.
Prior to our flight we made several attempts to log on to your online system in Manage my booking, only to be presented with an “Ooop’s error” message. This of course was extremely frustrating. We also attempted to call your Customer Service line, but again had no success with this.
We advised this to the Counter staff who knew nothing about the process as they are not VietJet staff only handling crew and therefore could not provide any assistance or advice on how to resolve the issue with our E sims.
There was no issue with our contact details as we received all emails with regards to the several changes to our outbound flight VJ900.
We then boarded the flight and advised the flight stewards of the situation, and they too could not help. They then advised that they will be putting through a complaint on our behalf, and they also gave us this email address to contact, so we can follow up on the complaint.We also paid for HOT SEATS extra leg room on the A320 NEO, we never received this either, as you had added extra seats on the flight, and our seats had been moved forward with NO EXTRA leg room at all, we were in seats 5A and 5B. we tried the seats in front of us and they had plenty of leg room. We advised the flight attendant that we had paid for extra leg room, and he didn’t care at all and all he wanted us to do was take our seats. We were extremely disappointed with the service that your airline advertised but did NOT supply. There was no empathy at all given to us about our situation on both flights.
Your customer service, well that does NOT exist at all, the staff never smiled never said hello or welcomed us on any of the flights, it was as if they really did not want to be there and would rather be out with friends socializing, not at work.
Before we  were grounded in Ho Chi Minh City your airline would have known about the Typhoon hitting Han OI, BUT you still let the flight leave knowing that we were going to be diverted to Ho Chi Minh City, this was a disgusting situation YOU put us in, we had a flight full of Indians that had connecting flights to catch. Had they been advised of the diversion prior to take off or shortly into the flight them tempers and outrage could have been avoided. We had to endure these people being verbally abusive towards all of us including to ground staff  in Ho Chi Minh City, not knowing what was going on.

The seats were empty but they were not ready to reassign and what a illogical solution they gave while having empty seats. So yes, you can try as it is budgeted, but don’t expect good services from them. They are on time and flight is cheap, this is the only benefit. With cheap prices, their services are also cheap.

What I found also very funny was the terrible Vietnamese they used. I discovered later the cabin crew were all Korean and could use english but their Vietnamese was rudimentary.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,terrible! terrible! DO NOT BOOK!!,"Terrible airlines. Have family booked with vietjet for the recent holidays and I can honestly tell you: absolutely terrible. Such a hassle and feels like a scam to us.
- credits: our aunt had credits from prev flight. Change of plan so had to cancelled a deluxe ticket, costed her $200AUD to cancelled. Her credit can purchase ticket but have to call up using it. Has to use the same phone that is listed. I found if you are overseas, then have to roam to purchase to change ticket.

- getting in contact with them is long waited phone call. Nil online services- thwy wont solve ur issues.
- phone call is international so unless you have free international call, it will cost to contact them when issue arises.

- name has to be exact. My brother is duo citizen. So passport on both is not written the same order. Other airlines has nil issues because he present them with both passport. only Vietjet has problem so he had to pay a fee everytime for this holiday. The name has to match the passport he used to book. But he used australian to book and used vietnamese passport to travel around vietnam- vietjet made hime pay everytime. He never had problem with other airlines, only vietjet does.

- credits: can only purchase ticket or use to buy food via phone. Cannot be used in flight (because you have to call up and use it). Food via credits has limited options/basic. If you wanna have a different menu, have to pay for it via cash on board
Credits Cannot be used to buy kgs with a promotion. As in if you have extra kgs for free. Add on kgs with credits will forfeited ur promotion kgs. I mean who does this?
Credits can be used to change name or buy kgs but has to be same currency. So for thise that travel multiples destinations- it is a pain in the butt as ur credits will keep accumulating.
Credits has to be the same currency. My friend bought a flight from Singapore to HaNoi (Deluxe ticket). Due to the Yagi storm- she cancalled it and now cannot use its credits for the flight HCM to Melbourne because its in Singaporean. Absolutely annoyed because how else would she use this credit?

- complaint made to Vietjet, staff said “theres nothing we can do” then proceed to hung up the phone. Poor customer service!!

- delays: very smart as in will delays little by little so they wont have to compensate with meals and hotel. Delays by a few hours at a time.

- they wont even provide you with cups of water as basic human need like jetstar. You have to buy water coming from HCM to Melbourne.

I mean I understand its a budget airline but so far, the worst i have seen.
This is the last time our family will be buying from this rubbish company.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible company!!,"Terrible company, do not buy ticket from Vietjet. Would rate 0 star if can. 

Had families booked with vietjet and i can tell you a few things.  

- I had credits from a deluxe ticket (costed money $200 to cancelled ticket cause i couldnt go, but if you want to change date, it wont cost, you just have to pay difference in ticket pricing). 
But changing ticket is such a hassel. Must be 
Using same phone number listed when you buy. So when overseas and problem arises, email wont do. I had to turn on roaming to call from my phone. Waiting for someone is long, not efficient . 
Hassell to communicate with company!!

- credits left over must can be used only if you call up after you buy online. There is an option to buy ticket and pay later, then call up, state ur name, booking number to use credits. Same thing with buying extra credits fro kgs and meals. 

- credits cannot buy anything on flight again, because you cant call. Credits give you less options for meals. Hot food on flight has more options. Cant really use the credits for other things. 
Credits cannot buy souvenirs online.
Cannot buy food in flight. 
Cannot buy water inflight. 
Can buy meal combo buy calling. cannot buy seperate water since glass of water come with meal. Limited options

- No water offer on flight, you have to buy water. But Jetstar offers free room temp water as basic human needs. 

- my friend: going to vietnam from singapore, bought ticket in Singaporean since flight from singapore but had credit in Singaporean since cancelled due to Yagi storm- this credit cannot be usedto buy kgs, food for flight from HCM to Melbourne cause different currency (cause shes going back to Melbourne. The credits cannot be used to buy food, change name for the flight going to Vietnam cause simple- its in different currency. So your only hope is to book another- but again, we dont know what to do with this credits.  

- few complaints was made by phone- they simple said “sorry, this is how it is, we cant help you” and proceed to hung up phone. Gives customers no resolutions. 
This is enough reasons for us to NOT ever book with Vietjet again.

- delays: they are very smart in-term of delays. So any delays will be less than 4hr then further delay again due to not offering you any hotel stay, meal voucher or for you to change of flight. 

- name change: as a duo citizen. The name is not the same on passport due to the order of the name. Travelling as a duo citizen, for other airlines- nil problem. For Vietjet: it is a problem since you will have problem “with immigration”. Umm no, have been travelling to multiples countries and nil issues, since we can provide with all  necessary documents. 
So had to change which costed money. 

Again, i do not recommend this company. 
It has been such a hassel for our family. Now, we have plenty of credits and dont know what to do with it.

Booking Number: VDX477

On the day of our flight to Vietnam with my son, we were prevented from boarding at Sydney Airport due to a gender discrepancy on my visa—it showed male, while I am female. The airline representative explained that Vietnam would not accept the visa with this error and advised us to wait until everyone else had boarded so they could assist us further.

At the VietJet Air check-in counter, the supervisor provided us with two options: reschedule the flight for Monday or receive a credit valid for 6 months. We chose the credit as advised, since obtaining a new visa within 2 days was not feasible.

However, when we attempted to redeem the credit online, we were informed that the cancellation had not been processed in time. I am extremely frustrated and disappointed. If the supervisor provided incorrect information or if there is an error, it is unacceptable to lose $600. According to consumer rights, I am entitled to clear and accurate information, and the supervisor’s confirmation that I would receive credit if we did not change the flight date is binding.

I am about to go to the airport to address this issue in person and expect an immediate review and resolution. I hope that the credit will be granted as initially assured.

If it weren't for the staff my rating would be a 0. Nothing included except for the flight, no food, no drinks, no travel pack (eye mask, blanket, pillow, etc), no entertainment, no wifi and no way to charge your phone if it goes flat. They do constantly push for you to preorder food or buy their travel pack when purchasing your ticket and I did both, but assumed I could still buy drinks and or additional snacks during the flight if required.
The inflight menu says they take card or cash so we spent the last of our cash in Ho Chi Minh and found out they didn't have an EFTPOS machine on the plane and there's no way of purchasing anything without 
Money. I had to ask for a glass of ice as I didn't have cash for a bottle of water.
Due to Australian restrictions we weren't allowed to buy or bring water / liquids into boarding area of the airport. It would have been good if the staff had of made an announcement stating there was no EFTPOS available in the boarding area or upon bag drop.

Make sure you have offline entertainment on hand and your phone fully charged as there are no screens and no charge points.

The chairs are thin and small. 
Do not get the side Exit Row seats if you have big thighs or don't find sitting in a child's plastic chair comfortable as the seats may have leg space out front they are very snug as the arms are fixed. Try for the middle Section of the exit row.

The temperature wasn't consistent and would go from hot to cold and there were no air vents only a light.

The toilets hadn't been cleaned, there was someone's head grease on my window and trash still in seat pocket. As our flight wasn't full we were offered to buy an extra seat for only 400,000 dong.

At the time of boarding at Hanoi, the aircraft’s electrical system went down. The flight was delayed by an hour but no updates at all from anyone until I walked up to the counter. 
The bathroom stinks bad, and the carpet mould smells bad as well.
Scheduled ETA 7:55 PM but due to technical glitch we were landed at Danang airport, then another plane to Da lat making its actual ETA 12:00 AM.
Understood that these things are uncontrollable but the least they could have done but did not are:
1) Proper channelling of the information. Had no idea what was going on until I got down. 2) Provide food or some snacks during the hold but nothing.
3) Compensate for the delayed caused.",Date of travel: August 2024,
1.0 of 5 bubbles,WORST AIRCRAFT EVER,"I recently had a horrible flight experience with @VietjetIndia airline, and I feel compelled to share my experience. From start to finish, the service was abysmal, and the staff's behaviour was unacceptable.  

On July 29, 2024, I was flying from India to Bali with my husband and two other pals. It was a connecting flight with a stopover in Vietnam en route from Delhi to Bali. 

 To begin with, they confused and stressed us out by giving the erroneous boarding card, which added needless anxiety and uncertainty. Each of the four boarding passes was from Delhi to Vietnam. Our boarding permit from Vietnam to Bali was forgotten. The ground crew mistreated my spouse and pretended to be busy when he went to ask them questions. Following my conversation with them, they subsequently corrected their error. Their recklessness might have landed us into terrible problems.
When we requested a glass of water on our first flight from Delhi to Vietnam, the flight attendants rather rudely ordered us to get it from the pantry on our own. 
When we arrived at the boarding gate at the Vietnam airport to board our next aircraft to Bali, they extremely, impolitely instructed us to move along as they were boarding a different flight number. Despite the fact that we had followed our boarding card and arrived at the right gate, our flight was delayed, and they neglected to notify us of this. We began to panic, believing that we had missed our flight, and we frantically looked for help, but no one seemed to want to help.
We discovered, at last, that the airline had misplaced my friend's luggage and had instructed us to wait for an ambiguous period of time after arriving in Bali. It took her two days and a thousand follow-ups before she finally got her suitcase.
That wasn't the end of our horror. My spouse and I were subjected to even more abuse and humiliation by Vietjet during our return trip to Delhi on August 3, 2024, which included a layover in Vietnam. We were unable to complete the online web check-in due to some issues with their website, so we took a screenshot of the error message and arrived at the airport four hours early in order to prevent any more drama or tension. 
 We were the first people in queue when we went to pick up our boarding passes at Bali airport. I asked the ground staff for an aisle seat because I was sick, but he very rudely responded, ""even if you pay, I won't cater to your request, we are overbooked,"" which I subsequently found out was a blatant lie. He generated all four boarding permits after rejecting my request, giving my husband and I the last seats. We were permitted to bring 7 kg of cabin bags apiece and paid an additional fee to carry 20 kg of main luggage on our round-trip flight. After taking our main suitcase, which weighed 17 kg, he asked us to weigh our cabin bags. The total weight of our two cabin bags was 13 kg. He then asked us to weigh our phones, neck pillows, purses, and iPads—a question he asked no other passenger.  He told us to get out of the queue and reorganise our luggage when it weighed more than 14 kg and he retained our boarding cards to himself. He raged at us, left his station without saying anything more, and began helping other passengers when I informed him it was unfair for him to weigh our phones and pillows because no other passenger was doing so. His actions utterly stunned and humiliated us. The woman behind the counter asked him about his ridiculous request when I went to another counter with my plea, but he didn't want to answer. Despite the fact that he was wearing a mask, I recorded him to report this problem.
The flight attendants collected our food and drink bottles, which we had purchased at the airport, to take on board after all the hassle when we eventually arrived at the boarding gate. The flight attendants refused to give me a glass of water when I requested for one during the five-hour flight to Vietnam because they had taken mine, claiming I had to purchase one. Since I don't have any Indonesian currency, I stated I could pay with a card. They responded that they didn't have a swipe machine, therefore I would just need to pay with cash. The flight attendants continued to act uncharacteristically, despite their flight handbook explicitly stating that they accepted both.
Never in my whole life had I felt so powerless. VietJet refused to give me a glass of water, which is a basic requirement on any flight, even though I was thirsty. The flight attendant informed me I could either buy a bottle with cash or use the aircraft toilet basin when I told him I was too thirsty to continue controlling myself.
There were plenty of unoccupied seats on the aircraft, and the ground crew very conveniently declined my request. I have all the evidence I need to back up my claims and demonstrate their poor treatment. It was worse than a nightmare, VietJet. In order to prevent other travellers from going through the same trauma that my spouse and I endured, I wanted to share my experience.
Overall, this was one of the worst airline experiences I've ever had. VietJet's staff and service were both horrendous. I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with them to look elsewhere. Avoid VietJet at all costs!

1. In-flight Service: Poor

2. Food: Expensive - I paid $50,000 Dong (~ $3AUD) for 1 350mL water bottle

3. Hygienists: Extremely poor - toilet so dirty - Photos taken just after Flight take off and seatbelt light turn off, for departure and return route.

4. Return route is horrible, VietJet Air check-in multiple routes at the same time. My return route departure at 19:55pm and I arrived at Tan Son Nhat airport at 16:40pm for check-in, took my family for more than 3 hours for check-in and custom. At the time I arrived at departure gate, and I noticed that people are already allowed move to the aircraft.
5. Return route is a nightmare, crews' member walking all night to service customers order food and drink.

6. Hotline Support number is horrible, took me more than 4 hours to get through.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Paid Extra for a Missed Flight: Avoid Impossible Connections,"VietJetAir may be cheap, but I absolutely do not recommend it. 
Here's why:

Three days before departure, my flights were changed to a connection that was impossible to make. 
Here’s what happened:

Original Flights:

VJ894: 14:05 Bali → 16:55 Ho Chi Minh
VJ640: 20:30 Ho Chi Minh → 21:50 Da Nang
Changed Flights:

VJ894: 14:05 Bali → 16:55 Ho Chi Minh
VJ634: 15:45 Ho Chi Minh → 17:05 Da Nang

As you can see, the arrival time of the first flight is later than the departure time of the second flight, making the connection impossible. 

I contacted them to change to a flight the next day, but even after several follow-ups, more than 36 hours passed without the change being processed, and it was less than 24 hours until my original departure.

I had no choice but to purchase a new ticket for the Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang leg from another airline, at my own expense.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Vietjet Air : Worst Flight Experience - Fire or Get Well trained staff and services,"We flew from India to Hanoi and then decided to go from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. We had made the flight ticket booking a month prior while booking. They asked for our first name and last name, so we did the same at the time of check-in. They mentioned that our 12:50 PM flight was delayed to 2:30 PM. We had already made bookings in Ho Chi Minh City and could not take that 2:30 PM late flight. Hence, the person at the check-in counter suggested that we take the 9:50 AM flight. We did so, but they had an issue with our name on the ticket. We were asked to go to the customer counter to clarify if it would be okay. They said it would not be okay.

We have traveled multiple times internationally and domestically and never come across this issue. While we tried to have a conversation with the customer care counter, they were very rude, and VietJet Air was the worst choice we ever made in our lives, as they know how to loot people. We had already paid for our flight tickets. They could have just compensated us and put us on another flight for the same cost, but instead, they asked us to pay 2 million dong and buy a new ticket. We asked them for a discount at least, given that they would be selling the previous ticket to someone else and profiting from it, and we had already spent a lot of money. They did not budge even a little bit. Also, they were so rude that we even told them to be nice, but their response was sarcastic and unruly. That is when we lost our temper and didn’t have a choice.

Now, while I am sitting at the airport, waiting for the next flight, my boyfriend is already on his way, as they did not even ask us or clarify if it would be okay but had already checked in our luggage. This entire situation is terrible. VietJet Air really needs to train their employees or fire them; their behavior was terrible. Attached below is the image of the 3 staff members we had to deal with. We respect the policy and the law of Vietnam, but the customer care and service from VietJet Air are the worst, and the flight is uncomfortable. If given the chance and the power, we would sue them for how they behaved and spoke. It was not just us who had this issue, but four other people had the same problem, which clearly shows it wasn’t an “us” problem, but a VietJet Air problem.",Date of travel: August 2024,

Nobody took any drinks from us at the gate, as someone said earlier. 

But things to know before you book: 
—-You can bring what you have paid for. So if you ticket says 20kg checked in luggage and 7kg hand luggage DONT EXPECT you can bring 21 kg or 8kg hand luggage. ITS THAT SIMPLE. 
—-Don’t book with Vietjet if you have to be on time, f.ex. to catch another flight. I have the suspicion that  they cancel domestic flights to fill their flights up. You can cancel your ticket but don’t expect them to give you your money back. Many reports you just get a voucher instead.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Consider another airline,"This airline utilizes deceptive practices. Upon check-in this month (8/2024 for a flight from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang) my party and I were made aware that we were unable to do so. When asked why, the agent reported that our middle names were not listed on the tickets. I've taken many flights in my life, and my middle name has never been requested to purchase a ticket.  Prior to the purchase of the tickets, the VietJet website didn't didn't indicate the need to list our middle names, otherwise, we would have done so. In order to proceed with the check-in process, we were instructed to leave the check-in counter, stand on a ticketing line, and pay a fee for adding the middle names to each ticket. If the middle names were not added to the tickets, we wouldn't have been able to board the aircraft. The total fee for all 9 tickets was $184 USD. We weren't the only passengers requested to do so. There were about 9 others who were directed to pay the additional fee. It felt like highway robbery, especially since the website allowed for booking the tickets without the middle names. Upon return to Ho Chi Minh from Da Nang, the flight was 3 hours late, which ruined the evening plans. I'm on the fence about recommending this airline because of the money making scheme listed above. If you do choose to use VietJet, add your middle name (and middle names of additional passengers) to the ticket(s). The cabin crew members were friendly, there were no other issues with the flight.

I made sure I double checked with the lady at the check in desk ‘I can purchase on flight, cash/card??’ She replied ‘yes that’s right’. So I checked in. Made sure i had enough in my card to purchase on flight. 

I had bought a few bottles of water after security. I had a 10hr flight ahead of me, had to make sure I had enough water for the flight. I got to my gate where I had to board my flight, only to be told all liquids needed to be tipped out!

Thinking I could purchase more water on flight, I followed instructions and poured my water out. 

Once take off, I asked if I could purchase some water, they then go to say CASH…. I told the air hostess I only had card, they said sorry we only take cash. I explained to them ‘I was told to pour my water out, I only have eftpos, how am I meant to get a drink?’ They just walked away saying sorry. So for 10 hours I had no water! Food, I could do without, that’s okay! But water…. No! And to top it off, they have no AC vents so it’s extra hot on the plane! I was lethargic and weak, due to the hot air and no water for 10hours!

I was arguing with the staff, you should inform people from ground when your giving out the boarding  pass at least this will give people chance to organise something. Otherwise you might have to let your customers starve and thirsty for 9 hours.flight attendant were arguing  “ you can buy food”. I agreed to buy food because yes money is not a problem. And when I said you take credit card right ? they said no only cash…lucky that I had Aus dollars I was able to buy some water and food. And I questioned the staff what if I didn’t have cash on me today would you let us starve and thirsty all the way for 9 hours. Guess what. to my horror …when I was getting off the plane..I saw other customer actually telling the flight attendant that “ it’s your eftpos not working and they left us dehydrated for 9 hours, water is free everywhere”.

3. Not from airline but airport (Ho Chi Minh City) I came to gate from lunch and they did my security check. I was waiting at gates for next flight, in 3 minutes, one of the security personnels came and asked me to go back. He didn’t even understand English and all he was saying is “go back”.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"DONT FLY WITH VIETJET, NOT KID FRIENDLY","If You are going to travel with infants and kids using Vietjet . You should read this review . 

Vietjet has NO MORALS and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE . 

During our first flight from Perth to Ho Chi Minh City, we were allocated seats at the back of the plane, seat 38 with a 5months old baby , 3 years old toddler and 7 years old kid. It was highly inconvenient (hot, noisy and shaking) , especially considering we were traveling with young children who require extra attention and care. It was such a nightmare for my kids. My infant and toddler got sick after the flight. 

So for our return flight, I learned my lesson so I purchased front row seats, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4C, where we would be able to sit together with my husband and attend to the needs of our children more effectively. However, upon check-in, we were informed that our seats had been reallocated further down the plane, seats 14D, 14E, 14F, and my husband was assigned seat 17C, separate from the rest of our family.

We were informed that our seats had been given to business-class passengers without any further explanation or consideration. To make matters worse, she mentioned that we ""MAY or MAY NOT"" receive a refund. This dismissive and unsatisfactory response left us feeling angered and neglected.

The lack of empathy, understanding, and professionalism displayed by your staff during this experience is deeply concerning.",Date of travel: June 2024,

Their flights are consistently delayed without any explanation or apology.

To add insult to injury, their customer service is nonexistent. Their hotline is a joke - it's either constantly busy or simply doesn't work. When you manage to get through, the representatives are rude, unhelpful, and seem to have no idea how to handle even the simplest of inquiries.

I recently had the misfortune of flying with Vietjet Airlines from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City, and it was an absolute nightmare. Our flight was delayed not once, not twice, but THREE times! The original departure time was supposed to be at 15:30, which was then pushed to 16:30, then to 17:20, and finally to 17:45.

As I write this review, we are still waiting for our plane, and there is no clear communication from the airline staff about what is happening. The level of disorganization and lack of customer service is astounding. Passengers are left frustrated and stranded with no updates or apologies.

This experience has been incredibly disappointing and stressful. I strongly advise anyone considering Vietjet Airlines to think twice and explore other options. This airline clearly does not respect its customers’ time or provide the reliable service one expects when traveling.

We were taking a 2.5 hour flight from HK to HCMC.
Originally, the flight was supposed to leave at 7:00 pm and arrive at 9:30 pm (already a late flight with kids). We then got an email 2 days before saying our flight was delayed by 30 mins. On the day of the flight, we got another email saying the flight would be delayed another 2 hours. When we got to our gate at the airport, there was no one to check our boarding passes. Everyone was in the queue to go into the plane but there was no staff around anywhere. When the staff FINALLY arrived, it was 10:00 pm. Once everyone was on the plane, we had to wait another hour just sitting there. The flight attendants never said anything about the situation and we were just waiting. At 11:30, the plane finally took off. We arrived in HCMC at 1:30 am, 4 hrs later than in the beginning. Immigration was VERY slow and that also took an hour. We got out the airport at 2:45 am and everything was not organised properly. 

Overall, it wasn’t sloppy, but very unorganised and managed. Hope you find this review helpful and it’s worth it to spend a bit more for much better results.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely Pathetic, Rude and Insulting Cabin Crew Experience that I have ever had in last 35 years of my traveling","Dear Travelers,

VietJetAir would stand out to be be the most pathetic, rude and insulting experience ever, in my history of traveling across the world in last 35 years. In fact they specialize in insulting the passengers, ignoring them and absolutely indifferent behaviour. 

Let me elaborate my experience :

01. Yes, they are the cheapest airlines in terms of cost but also the cheapest in terms of services offered. They call themselves as budget airlines and hence you should not expect anything more than the rude and  insulting behaviour from ground staff as well as the cabin crew.

02. It started with the check-in at HCMC airport. They automatically assigned a middle seat to me and If I want to change to any other seat, it would be chargeable (all the seats except the seat automatically assigned to you are chargeable). I asked for the aisle seat on the emergency exit and she said that it was already taken. I specifically asked her again that all the 4 aisle seats in 2 different emergency rows are taken and then she actually checked in her system. She had just bluffed the first time over. Then she said that it was available and I need to wait. She started checking-in other passengers putting me on the hold, even though I was standing in line for over 30 minutes. Then she disappeared for 10 minutes and came back to tell me that it will cost me 12 USD. I said Okay. I gave my credit card but she said that they do not accept credit cards. I gave USD 100 in cash to her and she said that I need to get the change as they do not have any change at the airport. I said that I have USD 11 cash and balance can be paid in VND but she said that they could not accept 2 different currencies. I gave up and I will take the seat, whichever is available. She reluctantly and irritatingly gave me aisle seats in the last rows near the toilet. I had no other option but to accept it.

03. The flight was already delayed by 45 minutes but she forgot to tell me at the time of check-in.

04. The flight was further delayed by 2 hours but they never thought about making any announcements.

05. Finally, they started boarding the flight without any reason or explanation of the delay. When I went  to the counter, they took away my boarding pass and told me that they had changed my seat to window seat, without asking me. I said that I do not accept it and they again asked me to the wait till everybody else checked-in. After 20 minutes of wait, they changed my seat 3 times and finally gave me an aisle seat with handwritten note on my boarding pass. All the while they were behaving as if they were obliging me and not a hint of apology in their attitude.

06. Since, they asked me to wait, I was the last one to get on to the bus that would take me to the aircraft. That bus full and no space for me to get onto it. There must be over 100 passengers in that bus, with the capacity of 70-80 people. This is absolutely against the safety rules but they did not care. They told me that this is the last bus and i have no other option but to get onto that bus like a cattle herding bus. This was not only insulting but ""we don't care"" kind of attitude by the staff. They came and pushed everyone inside for me to even get inside the bus. There was a lady with a small child and she fell down due to the push. But they did not care.

07. As I went on board and sat down on my assigned seat (hand written), the cabin crew wanted me to prove that this was the seat assigned to me. I was so upset and I told them to check with their onw staff and not ask me.

08. Then suddenly  a cabin crew boy named Heeui (Hieu 30), came and took out my laptop bag from the overhead storage and started pushing and banging on the top of the bag to make space for another bag. I got and told him that there is laptop inside and that he cannot push it or bang it as it was delicate. If he had asked me, I would have changed the place of my bag as there was a lot of space in the adjoining storage. But he was angry and he just threw my laptop bag and told me to manage it myself. I have never in my life seen cabin crew throw the laptop bag and he just ran away, as i started asking him the reason for his behaviour. He never came back to apologize or to say sorry. I came home to find my laptop broken and will need expensive repairs.

09. I also spoke to the Cabin Crew Supervisor and her name was Ms. Nhan H. She was trying to defend her colleague instead of saying sorry fo the same.

10. They also never gave me the meal that I had booked and paid for in advance. They changed my boarding pass and my seat numbers several times and the meal request was lost in this internal mistakes.

11. It seems that there has been a cultural difference and the young boys and girls who are ready to work for low salaries are recruited by the airlines. They are not trained and they do not even have the basic courtesies of hospitality industry. Their attitude is rude, insulting and downright pathetic towards all the passengers.

12. You ask for glass of water and they will say that they will come back to you after the the meal service is over. That would be after 2 hours and only if they remember about it. Most of the the time they do not remember and if you ask them again, they feel irritated.

13. They do not even give you a bottle of water if you are ready to pay for it. The standard answer is that we have some bottles left after we finish the meal service, we will sell it to you. It cannot get more pathetic or sad.

14. I do not understand as why we as Indians take these insults or rude behaviour, just because we are getting cheap tickets.

15. My bag wheel was broken and there is no action taken on the same so far. The t third party does the paperwork and then they forget about it...!!!!!!!

Vietnam is making millions through Indian tourists but do not think it is time to  invest in good training program for cabin crew staff. There are over 15 direct flights to Vietnam from India and we significantly contribute to their economy.

It is high time that Viet Jet Air takes this matter seriously,

Sad and Highly Disappointed,

2.0 of 5 bubbles,"A tedius, confusing and uncomfortable experience","First of all, the pros. The cost is great and they have a good safety record (better than other cheap airlines like China Southern, Air India etc). The flight time worked better with a REX flight from Tasmania as it means I didnt need to overnight in Melbourne which would have been the case if I took the 10.30am Vietnam Airlines flight.  The cons? Everything else. 

Booking process / Cost
Vietjet doesn't allow for multi-city bookings (I was flying into Saigon and out of Hanoi) so I booked through Webjet as it meant one booking, instead of having to book 2 x separate flights on the VietJet website. Because I booked through them, the fare also included baggage and a meal which isn't included on all fare types if you book with VietJet directly. FYI, the vegan meal was actually quite nice, curry and rice, a pack of roasted cashews and water. The total cost of flights through Webjet (including their booking fees) was about $850 return which was about $500 less than Vietnam Airlines. If we looked at it one way it was probably about $350 AUD.

Checking In / Boarding
I checked in online directly through VietJet's website (Webjet provides their PNR although I had to email them to get login details which was a hassle) which meant I could just do the bag drop at Tullamarine. This was good because there were about 200 people in the check-in line compared to 4 at bag drop.
Boarding was a shi*show. Aside from starting late (flight was due to leave at 12.30am but we were still boarding at that time) they didn't board in the groups on the ticket and there were only 2 people trying to scan people's boarding passes and there were hundreds of people on the flight.  They grabbed two other staff members from somewhere to help but they didn't seem to know what to do and kept having to ask the regular staff how to check people in. There was also some issue with people who didn't have bag tags on their carry-on and had to have that sorted out at the service desk which increased the delay with boarding. Because the airline is so crap, you have to get one of those buses to the plane and tbh, I don't even think we were in Tullamarine anymore by that point, the plane was so far away. Once on the plane, it sat on the tarmac for another 45 minutes with no announcement as to what was wrong. The most infuriating part? TWO horrifically screechy songs played over the speakers on a continuous loop and at 1am, tired and over it, I was ready to choose murder.

The flight / disembarking
The seats in economy are tiny, I'm 5ft 7 and I struggled to fit my legs in and unlike full-service airlines, if there's a spare row somewhere else, you can usually move. On VietJet, if you want to move, you need to pay and they will take your money on the plane to change seats. Funnily enough, they did offer a deal over the PA to upgrade to ""business class"" and one dude ditched his wife and kids within 15 minutes of getting on to take up this offer, what a nice guy. 
When we landed in Ho Chi Minh City, we sat on the tarmac for another 45 minutes with the same 2 songs blasting over the loudspeaker before piling into overcrowded buses. Like Tulla, it looks like VietJet doesn't get any kind of priority parking in HCMC Airport. Finally we were allowed to leave this nightmare before hitting passport control. Word of advice, you could be in the line anywhere from 45 min - 2 hours so unadvisable to have a connecting flight with a short transit time. I did have a transfer booked, but they waited for me although it was about an hour later than I was supposed to be there.

I will do a separate entry for the return flight because it was even more painful as I had to transfer through the domestic terminal in Ho Chi Minh once I had arrived from Hanoi. 

I have flown Jetstar and Air Asia internationally so I knew there was no in-flight entertainment, it would be cramped and service would be crap but I was prepared to deal with it because I was trying to save money. I'm 40 now and maybe in my 20s I could have handled lots of little annoying things but the amount of time I wasted and being physically uncomfortable was not worth the money I saved.

VietjetAir may not always be on time and will disappoint urgent travelers, but all in all I think this airline performs extremely well in a very competitive market and surviving and winning awards.

We travel quite a bit and it seems the missing middle name issue often occurs in Vietnam.  Tip 1: When you are purchasing your airline ticket online,  if there’s no separate “middle name” field available, I would include your middle name within the ""Given name” field. This will help minimize issues at check in.  Some of these airlines can be quite nit picky as they will look for any opportunity to squeeze another penny out of you.

I recently flew from Mumbai to Melbourne on a budget airline. While the price was attractive, there were several drawbacks to consider.

Seating Issues: Unfortunately, the airline didn't allow passengers to switch seats during the flight, even if empty seats were available. They surprisingly charged a fee for seat changes. This proved frustrating, especially as I was in the early stages of pregnancy and assigned a middle seat between two larger passengers. Despite my discomfort, a free seat change wasn't offered.

Limited Amenities:  The airline didn't provide complimentary blankets on board, and there was no in-flight entertainment system. Additionally, while two meals were included in the ticket, they were unfortunately bland and repetitive. Furthermore, unlike most airlines, even basic beverages like coffee and tea came with an extra charge.

Language Barrier: While I can't definitively say the flight attendants didn't understand English, there did seem to be a communication barrier. Their responses, coupled with laughter that came across as dismissive, left me feeling unsupported.

Overall: While the price was tempting, the combination of these factors made for a less than ideal flying experience. It's safe to say I'll be more selective when choosing airlines in the future.",Date of travel: May 2024,"[{'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

However, as my husband is American, he would require a visa just to stay in the transit area of Ho Chi Minh airport. As we already had other bookings made for our Lao trip we decided to take another airline the same day. We were assured that we would be refunded for our flights because of the two delays. I found out later from someone that he would have been asked to pay USD100 for the Vietnamese visa. And the website says that refunds are only given for delays beyond 4 hours.

As you can imagine, the heat and sunshine in Vietnam is unbearable. The sun was shining directly on my infant child. I pulled down the window blind and was scolded by the flight attendant and said it needed to be up. I explained that the sun was directly shining on my child, but the flight attendant said that it doesn't matter. He stated that the windowing blind has to be up during taxi and takeoff. I told him that the window blind has no effect on the plane during those times. He told me it was policy. I then asked if I was allowed to ready a magazine. He said yes, I took the magazine and held it up to the window to block the sunlight. He was not happy about that, but there was nothing he could do. The rest of the flight was well because there was no longer any interaction with the flight attendant.

My experience was ok-ish. 
Starting point from Bali, then a 10 hours layover in Hanoi, then final destination Osaka. 
To be honest my only concern was the checked in luggage which they eventually manage to lose. 
When I arrived exhausted in Osaka after 20 hours+ of commuting, I couldn't find my luggage. 
Luckily the Japanese authorities in Osaka gave them a call for me, they found my luggage in Vietnam and send it the next day to Osaka. 
It was annoying that I had to come again to the Osaka airport the next day, I wasted about 5 hours of commuting and spent around £30 (GBP) from my own pocket to commute but it worth it because I got my luggage back.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Hanoi Airport Experience with VietJet,"Hi,

We reached the Hanoi airport on 10th May 2024 to realize that our flight with Cambodia Angkor Air was cancelled. So, we had to book tickets from Hanoi to Siem reap. As we had hotel bookings and tours planned in Siem Reap from 11th May to 13th May 2024. 

We approached the ticket counter for VietJet in Hanoi airport. They had a flight out of Hanoi at 16.50 to Siem Reap. We requested for 4 tickets (family). They said they had tickets, and it would cost us 77,44,000 VND. We said we are ok with the price and asked her to issue the tickets. Then she told us that they will issue the tickets if we can show her 2000USD in cash. 

I asked is this the requirement of Cambodia and she said no it is VietJet air policy. I asked her to show me in writing which she could not. Then we were forced to withdraw 2000USD worth of cash from ATM machines in the airport. I had to move money into multiple bank accounts due to the limit of ATM withdrawals. This whole process took us more than 1 hour. I lost a lot of money due to higher per transaction charges in the airport and also conversion fees lower per INR in the airport (Loss of ~13,000 INR). 

After we reached back at the counter for the ticket the prices were now changed to 80,14,000 VND. When we questioned that how come the charges have changed, she said the extra baggage cost is higher now. 

The funny part is not one VietJet colleague even asked us for the USD currency. I can share the calculations, I have lost close to 12,000INR and not to mention I am stuck with more than 1700USD.",Date of travel: May 2024,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

They finally came up with a rule that I needed visa for vietnam, whereas I was traveling from amd to shanghai.
Well guys if you still want to fly this airline, you can try, but definitely not from Ahmedabad airport.

Only and a huge disappointment was ‘Vietjet’ airlines. 
Horrible sitting arrangements, bad aircraft conditions, not supplying passengers even a drop of water without payment were a few things which we actually ignored but the worst was’ ARROGANT BEHAVIOUR OF THE STAFF. Both ground and on flight 
Amongst the ground staff , two ladies shouted at us at 2 different occasions for no reason. They don’t understand English well and don’t take any efforts to understand what passenger is trying to say.
On board experience was even worse.
The aircraft was half empty but when passengers started switching to empty seats they demanded money for change of seats. One passenger was firm about not going back to his original seat. He was surrounded by 3 -4 crew members. Even the captain of the flight came sown and started threatening of returning flight to Vietnam. When one of the passengers started video recording of all the aggressive behaviour of the crew he was forced to stop n delete the recording. 
Are they not aware the salary paid to them comes from passengers money. 
On the other hand one of my family members had a broken, non reclining seat. In spite of complaining nobody paid attention.
After reaching Mumbai, Mr Vaidya, who refused to fall pray to all the threats by Vietnam crew, was held hostage at the airport and was pressurised to give an apology letter.
Why should we Indians be treated like this outside. Mr Vaidya should receive not only an apology letter from the airlines but a good compensation. He has not misbehaved with the air hostesses at all. The video was recorded by one of the crew members when she was extra polite with him and he was irritated by the earlier true behaviour of the crew. Even they made one of the passengers sign some document as a witness. We don’t know why the coward signed it.
My sincere request to everyone

- Selected and paid for seats for the flight out but did not get allocated these seats. Only realised after leaving the check-in desk and it was too late to do anything once we spoke to a staff member
- Low priority at Sydney airport for buses from the plane to the terminal. After landing we were stuck on the plane for about 30-40 minutes until we were able to get on a bus. They only had one bus, which was initially late and which then took forever to drop passengers and come back for another load. We got separated from our group as they got on a bus but we had to wait for the next one for 20 minutes (on the plane stairs)
- Be aware there is no entertainment and no usb charge points
- Be aware there is no food unless you buy it. - — Host/esses don’t talk to you at all or even offer you the menu, but they will stand next to you in the aisle with their trolley for a long time as that’s where they prepare the food (mainly ramen bowls)
- Be aware they do not even give out water, you have to buy it (even animals are offered water when being transported). This was a bit of a problem leaving Ho Chi Ming as security takes your water before boarding
- Narrow seats

The sixth time on our return from BBK to CNX was terrible.
As usual I booked Deluxe and  choose our seats for me my wife and son, 4D 4E 4F, going to BKK was ok as usual, but on the return trip our seat reservations had been changed  to 29E 30E 31E, we were split up in to different rows. I asked about the reason why I have paid for and booked my seats, and your company has split us up.

QUOTE FROM AIRPORT STAFF AT BKK.
Some Thai people wanted your seats so we gave them to those people because they are Thai.
My wife is Thai with a Thai Passport.
My son has a Thai and British Passport.
I have a British passport.
I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS.

NEW MOTTO FOR VIETJET.

If you are all not Thai don't bother to fly.

I have made a complaint to Vietjet through there website, but no reply.

2.It was a honest mistake while booking our flight I mistakenly placed my last name twice in the name filled. The security officer told us to go change the name at VietJet counter. To our surprise the person told us to pay extra to change the name. 

3.  Flight was delayed for 2 hours and without any announcement the gate was changed. 

Flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh.

1. We booked our prepaid seats and paid for extra baggage. Once again the app didn’t register. Just like all times no confirmation email received. Luckily this time we took a screen shot of the allocated seat and the baggage too because this information disappears on the app the second when it’s refreshed.

2. Send the email prior two days to customer support on the 1900 email however no response. Tried to call the 1900 number the calls doesn’t go through.

3. On the day of travel, we go to the customer support counter. We tell the problem. The support officer takes her time and confirms the  seat however we are given another seat telling us that’s an exit row seats that’s why we don’t get the seat. She gives us row one seat which we were happy. 

4. Extra baggage- we show the screen shot and our bank account charges however no effort was shown to help us. It seems she was pretending to do something on the screen and full time looking down doing something and it was nearly 25-30 minutes we waited. When we said what’s taking so long, she mentions that she can’t see our payments. We showed VietJet screenshot and the bank details of the charges however she didn’t accept that. So we had to pau one more time for extra baggage.

5. At the bag drop counter, they tried to charge extra for the bag again despite we gave the receipts from the previous counter. It was resolved quickly.

6. Had to wait for 35 minutes for the  baggage at the HCMC.

Worst airline ever.,"Flying economy with this airline brings new meaning to the term “cattle class”; although, I think I’d prefer to travel on a live-cattle export cargo ship than travel with this airline again. I have spent years traveling around the world to 60+ countries, and this airline has easily taken the award for the worst. Firstly, the seats don’t fit an average-sized human. So it feels like travelling in a sardine can. There are no individual air vents for passengers or seat rows, and it doesn’t feel like the cabin aircon was turned on either. Resulting in a very hot and uncomfortable long-haul journey. There is no complimentary water and they don’t take all cards for payment. So some are left to be dehydrated for an 8hr + flight, which is unsafe. I flew four times with this airline and each time, and each time they played the same two awful songs on repeat, which was maddening. The hot meals were uncomfortably aromatic. Combined with no airflow, the cabin smelled disgusting and made me nauseous. We booked a connecting flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh to Brisbane. They changed our domestic leg to one with a timing that meant we might not make our international flight. When we tried to be proactive, they wouldn’t help and adjust our international flight for the next day. Instead told us we would have to try to make the international flight, and if we missed it, we could be put on the next available international flight that might not be for a few days by then. I don’t know if I have anything positive to say about this airline except they didn’t crash. I’ll be happy to pay more and never fly with them again.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Money Hungry Budget Airline,"Personally i would avoid this airline at all costs. The inconsistency in their policies and service makes them a very amateur airline. 

Our plane from Australia to Vietnam was pretty much half empty, which they crammed everyone in the same section. We moved two rows in front of our original seats, which we had paid for, to spread out and were instantly pounced on to either move back or pay extra to move seats? We’d never experienced that before whilst flying, but none the less we paid to be more comfortable. That wasn’t necessarily the issue, although seems very scabby. The annoying part is other passengers starting changing seats yet they were not harassed to move back or pay? It left us feeling a little bitter, as we didn’t understand why it was one rule for us. Especially when the cabin crew said if we lay out or take up another seat we would have to pay for that too. When there were many people moving and laying across 3 seats with no trouble. Granted if your going to have that as your policy, make sure your crew are enforcing it to all passengers. 

We we’re given food on the flight over to Vietnam from Australia, but on the way back we weren’t given anything, barely even acknowledged by the cabin crew. Also they make you throw out your water before boarding the flight even if you buy from the airport to then charge you $3 for a tiny bottle of water. Yes their a budget airline with reasonable fares, but its not worth the hassle. They seem desperate to just rinse you ( wouldn't have been surprised if they charged you to use the toilet ) whilst giving an inconsistent and bad service with uncomfortable seats. Throughout both flights it felt like we were getting treated differently because we weren’t Vietnamese. Just spend the extra pennies and go with a better airline.",Date of travel: February 2024,"[{'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

We had four flights in all.  When we got at the Airport we were not allowed to board on the plane because the duty manager had said to us (me and my wife) and several other passengers in the que behind us,  that we needed VISA if we are using this airline,  to go the AMD airport with his airline even though we were not stopping or going out of the airport in India. He did not let us board and because of that we had to stay over night again in Hanoi and we lost all of our four flights !!!   We had to buy tickets all over, from Hanoi to Malta (Europe) and it cost us almost 2000 euros !!!  He wouldn't even let us at least change the flight with his airline to another day or even maybe he gives us a discount for a flight we will use of his airline being the most airline with routes we could use from Hanoi. We also arrived home two days later so it disrupted our work schedules too.

We have checked about this non sense argument he was telling us and in cases with other airlines the VISA is not required to enter in the international transit zone. For example Emirates, would make you fill an Embarkation card as you go inside the airport in India.   This manager was telling us that they have no such agreement with the AMD (India) Airport and if they let us board on the plane they will make us fly back to Hanoi and we and the Airline would get a hefty fine. :(( 

The next day we managed to organize a new flight schedule, this time through Taiwan (instead of India), then to Dubai, then to Cyprus, then to Malta. The first flight from Hanoi was with this ridiculous company, VietJetAir.com and they made us pay a super price of more then Euro 300 each for this one hour flight. (10 times there usual price)

This is a rip off that they do.  They tell you that you have no Visa and make you book the flights all over again with 10 times the market price. Let alone we had to go back to Hanoi in a Hotel at 11pm. We slept at 2am, and at 5am we had to be back at the airport because the flight was at 7am.   :(((((

This company doesn't tell you have your VISA ready to go to INDIA, They never tells you or notifies you of the 'So called - No agreement with the Indian Airport '   They do the mistakes and you pay for the consequences. They just don't care. They treated us like flys at the airport.

Airconditioning was poor, too warm, incredibly stuffy. seating was tight with limited legroom. Nothing was complimentary, I was feeling a bit wonky in the middle of the night and asked for a cup of water, yes but you need to pay for water. I said don't bother and the stewardess didn't bother. The plane was old and shabby and looked like it needed a good clean. There were plenty of spare seats available and an Australian couple sitting next to me asked the stewardess if it was ok for one of them to move into the seat in front which had 3 unused seats. There were whole rows of unused seats. The next 5 minutes was taken up with a detailed explanation of how that spare seat would have to be purchased and the $US pricing.  They ended up paying for the seat. Sure enough, not long after the plane had taken off, people from further down the plane snuck into the spare seats lying across three seats where available. Of course the stewards noticed but after a couple of attempts gave up enforcing the payment rule. This purchasing of seats mid flight was a new concept to me. It seemed to be a major focus for the flight stewards to try to upsell the unused seats. Customer service seemed like the last thing on their mind. The whole customer experience was terrible.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Unprofessional Flight Attendant-Need re-training,"An Open Complain Letter to Vietjetair:
Dear Sir/Madam,
    I am writing to bring to your attention a deeply concerning incident that occurred during my recent flight with Vietjetair which has left me extremely dissatisfied with the level of service provided. I was a passenger on "" Flight VJ877 -  HKG to SGN - 01 February 2024 - 19:10 Boarding.
    1)  At the beginning of the flight, I noticed the front flight attendant locked the W.C. toilet door and not allowing any passengers to use and the Red Light indicated the Toilet W.C. was engaged. At approximately one hour and twenty minutes, I walked to the "" Front"" W.C. and Ms. Nguyen Hxxx Nathiline confronted me that the W.C. toilet was reserved for Pilots' use only and the passenger did not allowed to use it, However, I confronted to her that I witnessed her locking the W.C. from outside and in addition, I never heard that any airline reserves the front W.C. toilet for the crew use only, I said she does not want to clean up the bathroom. I believe this caused her to start the beginning of angry with me.
    2) Approximately one and a half hours after takeoff at about 21:00, I encountered an incident that not only marred my flight experience but also reflected poorly on the professionalism and conduct of your flight attendant Nguyen Hxxx Nathaline. 
    While in midway through the flight, I found myself involved in an altercation with Ms. Nguyen Hxxx Nathaline because my neighbor seat passenger was continuing to cough causing me concerned he had COVID, I found out that there was one empty seat and I was changing to that seat to avoid infect COVID. I asked another flight attendant for permission to allow me to change seat and she was alright with that.
    The flight attendant in question exhibited highly unprofessional behavior by raising her voice and engaging in a heated argument with me. I asked the other flight attendant from the back row to witness Ms. Nguyen Nathaline's uncontrol behaviour, This behavior was not only distressing but also completely unacceptable given the circumstances. Moreover, instead of attempting to diffuse the situation, the flight attendant escalated the confrontation by refusing to listen to reason and disregarding my attempts to resolve the issue amicably.
    Furthermore, when another flight attendant intervened to calm the situation and extend an apology on behalf of Vietjetair, I was shocked to witness the initial flight attendant instructing her not to apologize to me. This blatant disregard for customer service and basic courtesy is deeply disappointing and does not align with the standards that one would expect from a reputable airline such as Vietjetair.

    Adding to the discomfort of the situation, I was informed by the same flight attendant that the front W.C. toilet was reserved exclusively for the pilot's use and was subsequently denied access to it. This arbitrary restriction is not only absurd but also inconvenienced me unnecessarily during the flight.

    I am appalled by the unprofessional conduct displayed by your flight attendant and the lack of proper customer service exhibited by Vietjetair. As a paying customer, I expect to be treated with respect and courtesy at all times, and this experience has left me deeply disappointed.

    In light of the aforementioned incident, I kindly request that Vietjetair thoroughly investigate this matter and take appropriate disciplinary action against the flight attendant involved. Additionally, I urge you to review your policies and procedures regarding customer service training to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.

    I hope that Vietjetair will take this complaint seriously and take proactive steps to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

     Key Points of this Complaint:
   * Flight Attendant Name: Nguyen Hxxx ( Nathaline) Crew Manager
   * Flight VJ 877, Hong Kong - Ho Chi Minh, 01 February 2024, 19:10 Boarding
   * Flight Attendant "" Lie"" to the passenger of the front W.C. is reserved for pilot use only.
   * The Flight Attendant as crew manager, "" But"",  did not try to calm and ease the incident down but instead encouraged other flight attendants to be involved in the disagreement with the passenger. argument.

Sincerely

1.0 of 5 bubbles,AVOID AT ALL COST! Does not care about its customers!,"the airline does not care about people with disability, children or babies. They don’t prioritize them. Flights typically have a shuttle to the airport. The shuttle is packed like sardines and their procedure does not consider all their customers. I watched a family consisting of a baby, toddler, mom and dad get trampled by people then they were last on the bus only to get smushed by other customers. Luckily one of the customers were kind enough to give up a seat. 

I’ve never experienced any other airline that does not prioritize disabled people, pregnant mothers, or smaller children. This is a cash grab airline company that does not care about its customers. Which is such a shame for an airline company in the travel industry. Leaders at corporate need to reevaluate their policies. 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINE. Avoid at all cost. Book somewhere else, it’s not worth the poor protocol. Support a place that cares about you as a customer.

The flight was scheduled to depart at a certain time, but unfortunately, we experienced a delay of approximately 4 and a half hours. This unexpected delay significantly inconvenienced me and disrupted my travel plans, causing frustration and discomfort.

To compound matters, during the extended wait, no complementary meals were provided to passengers. Considering the substantial delay, the lack of provision for basic sustenance was disappointing and unacceptable. Many passengers, myself included, were left feeling neglected and hungry as we awaited further updates on our flight.

Adding insult to injury, I was surprised to discover that water, a basic human necessity, was chargeable onboard the flight. In a situation where passengers were already inconvenienced by a lengthy delay, the additional cost for something as fundamental as water felt unreasonable and insensitive.

Overall, my experience with VietJet Airlines fell far short of expectations. The significant delay coupled with the absence of complementary meals and the charge for water left a negative impression. As a frequent traveler, I value punctuality, comfort, and fair treatment of passengers, all of which were lacking in this instance.

Our flight, VJ896, was scheduled to depart from New Delhi International Airport at 00:05. However, to my utter dismay, the flight departed a staggering three hours late, at 3 am. This flagrant disregard for punctuality and customer convenience is utterly inexcusable and resulted in significant inconvenience and distress for myself and my family.

As if this initial debacle wasn't infuriating enough, the subsequent events only served to compound our frustration and anger. Upon arriving at Ho Chi Minh Airport for our connecting flight to Bali, we were informed that our flight had been changed without any prior notification. Despite our desperate attempts to seek assistance, we were met with a shocking lack of customer service from VietJet Airlines. The absence of any form of support or guidance left us stranded and vulnerable in an unfamiliar airport, exposing us to unnecessary risks and further aggravated our already dire situation.

Yet the nightmare did not end there. On February 4th, 2024, during our return flight from Bali to New Delhi via Vietnam with VietJet Airlines (Flight VJ848), we were subjected to yet another ordeal. Despite arriving at Ngurah Rai Airport well in advance of our scheduled departure at 14:00, we were unceremoniously detained by security personnel and falsely informed that our flight was delayed. Hours of agonizing wait later, we discovered that our flight was, in fact, on time, and the misinformation peddled by VietJet Airlines staff was nothing short of a scandalous betrayal of trust.

The cumulative impact of these harrowing experiences cannot be overstated. The utter lack of professionalism, communication, and accountability demonstrated by VietJet Airlines and, by extension, Dpauls Travel Agency, is nothing short of an affront to basic standards of decency and integrity.

Make sure your travel dates are solid and absolutely do not pay any fees that customer service tells you to pay over the phone! Terrible, terrible experience.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst experience ever!,"First and last time flying with Vietjet. First, the flight arrived on time, so did the crew but still we departed one hour late. Second, had to make a 20 minute line because only 2 toilets were working. And third, in a 9 hour trip we couldn’t eat absolutely anything because they only accept cash and credit card. Debit card wasn’t good enough for them. Before getting to the gate the officials check your luggage (if you are travelling to Australia) and take out all food and drinks that could be “dangerous”. We weren’t even able to take the water bottle for our baby. So, given that we couldn’t buy any food or drink we literally begged for some water for our baby, which they gave us. Lucky for my baby I was still breastfeeding. Still, after 6 hours of not eating or drinking anything my body stopped producing milk and my baby was desperate crying because she was starving. I prefer paying more next time for a ticket with an airline that includes all services or at least one that tells you that you need to bring cash or a credit card if you want to eat something in a long trip. Unfortunately, we literally got what we paid for; a cheap service. No offer is worth travelling with Vierjet ever again.",Date of travel: January 2024,
4.0 of 5 bubbles,They’re ok,"Downsides:
-	Legroom in economy class is minimal
-	No frills at all
-	Our first flight with them (Hanoi --> Phu Quoc) was rescheduled several times over the few days preceding, eventually settling on a time about an hour later than our initial booking; our second flight (Phu Quoc --> Hong Kong) was not rescheduled but instead just delayed by nearly an hour (though it did still, somehow, manage to land in HK almost on time)

Upsides:
-	Incredibly cheap
-	Our baggage, in contrast to a number of the reviews below, arrived very promptly both times

From our experience: if economy is your primary consideration and you don’t mind the risk of being a bit late, they’re probably a good choice.  If they were expensive, I'd give them 2 stars, but for the money we paid I have no significant complaints.",Date of travel: February 2024,

If you think about travel in vietnam, don’t ever buy this airline tickets. Go to vietnamairlines. You gonna safe yourself so much more time and money.
They gonna look a bit cheaper at first. But then they gonna get your money out of the pocket one way or another. 
My first time was a domestic flight, from ho chi minh city to da nang city. They weigh your carry on luggage right in front of the door to get in the airplane. So I have to pay extra to got my carry on check in because they a little bit over weight. After that I thought I’m never going to go with this airline ever again on my life.
But my older sister got me a ticket to Brisbane, Australia from ho cho minh city.
They didn’t let me get in the airplane just because I got my passport renewed. Doesn’t make any sense to me at all. So I have to pay extra to rebook the ticket. 
And update my visa by myself at home, so I can get on another airplane a few days later. I know they could do that within a few minutes but they refused to do so.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Probably the worst airline available at the moment,"Terrible experience. There are lot of things which contributed to this review. 

1) I send an email to their customer service regarding baggage size and I got reply after 19 days.

2) Except for the first time they send most emails in Vietnamese or some other language. Anyway it's not English.

3) My flight from Kochi was supposed to leave at 11:50PM, Around 8 at night I got an email saying flight is delayed and it will leave at 3:50AM the next day. Delay is acceptable if there is some technical issue, but my flight was a connected one so I need to go to Vietnam first and then board another flight to Brisbane. This was planned by VietJet it self. But the delay email didn't mention anything about the connecting flight and there was no officer from VietJet to contact and their contact numbers never work. The connected flight was supposed to leave at 10:30AM and the new timings mentioned that this flight will only reach Vietnam at 10:30AM.

4) Till 3AM the airport officials said the flight hasn't arrived Kochi yet to go to Vietnam.

5) Reached Vietnam around 11 AM and they delayed the connection flight  so that everyone from Kochi could board this flight. ( Really appreciated that at that time).

6) In an 8+ hr long flight they didn't accept card payments to buy food.

7) Reached Brisbane but most of the people who boarded from Kochi didn't get their luggage. Had to complain at the baggage services at Brisbane Airport.

8) Didn't get any email regarding the luggage for two days and I decided to contact their available numbers most of them doesn't work and finally got one which is working. Most of the times it says there is too many calls to the customer service and will cut the call.

9) Finally got connected with someone and they gave me a number which doesn't work to find details regarding my bag. This happened twice and they gave two different numbers which doesn't work.

10) Got connected again and this time they asked for PIR details and then said they have requested the airport for details. Asked how much time it will take, The answer is they don't know. Asked where my bag is, same answer. Asked whether I will get any compensation, guess what the answer is ""THEY DON'T KNOW. Talked with the guy for around 1 hr and lost my patience. asked him to connect me with someone who is responsible for this or someone who can give me some proper reply. They don't do that as well. So i had to yell at him.

11) Same thing happened with another girl as well. They think it's not their responsibility to get the baggage to their customer. 

What is the point of having a customer care if they can't help. They don't have much working phone numbers. Extremely poor service. One could argue that it is what you will get for a budget airplane. But at least they should have the responsibility to take ownership of losing multiple luggages. If it's just mine and they are doing it, I can understand but a lot of people lost their luggage and they don't give a s*** about it. Most of the times the customer service says send an email, If they won't reply for 19 days then what's the point of doing that.",Date of travel: February 2024,"[{'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

Will not use again.","Extremely poor airline staff at check in, provided a visa and they wouldn't accept it, after questioning and after further research, i advised them if not happy with visa i can still obtain visa on arrival, which they refused, never offered to assist is fixing issue at all. all the information i was given is 'you need to apply for another visa and we can reschedule for next fight in 3 days and $150 extra for each person'.
Resulted in me not been allowed on flight. We were not the only people this happened as well. So missed the flight, had to apply for urgent visa (another $250), was able to book another flight with a different airline without issues 14 hours later ($650). 
As a results we lost approx. 1.5 days and $1000 due Vietjet been unprofessionalism, terrible assistance/support and incorrect knowledge. 

On return, received approx. 3-4 emails within 24hours of flight departing of the times changing from 22:20 to 14:15 to 16:20, causing stress of missing the flight and as well having to change plans of sightseeing attractions booked. I feel sad of elderly or people without access to emails whilst away would have no idea. And due to flight departing earlier, resulted in a significant longer layover, which resulted in having to organise a hotel for the night at our cost. both flights of Vietjet used to returned home were delayed, nothing was on time. 

Only positive thing I could say is the actual flight attendants on the plane are professional, well spoken and handled the customers on the plane well including the guy standing of the arm rest to reach bag from overheard compartment instead of been patient.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrible. Avoid at all cost.,"Vietjet notified my partner they had rescheduled his flight 6 hours before flight time. This meant he would miss his connection in Hong Kong. Because of Chinese New Year there is no way to reschedule the connection.

Vietjet took NO responsibility for the issue. Did not even say 'sorry'. Said the ticket price could not be refunded because it was less than 24 hours before flight time. Completely missing that THEY had changed the flight time so Vietjet should be responsible. Ticket was booked through a travel company (Trip.com) so Vietjet said only they could apply for the refund as their policy is only calls from the booking number can be refunded. Of course, this doesn't work. Trip.com should stop doing bookings with Vietjet.

In addition, this kangaroo court tell us that any refund would be in flight credits instead of currency (useless when you do not plan on going back). As if that isn't bad enough, they then say that you need to pay an 'application fee' to have the money refunded. Get this...the 'application fee' costs more than the flight.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Love Vietnam but not Vietjet,"Way way way way (way) too mean with their space. It should be illegal to transport people from Australia to the wonderful Ho Chi Minh City (& return) when jam packed in like sardines. I’m 174 cms and 75 kgs, certainly not large. We had no room to move. It’s was awful. Think cheap nasty domestic flight but international. Packed in for hours and hours. Knees against the seats in front. It’s a disgrace. The owners of Vietjet are clearly only catering to tiny people, are super greedy and their ‘number of seats’ policy is inconsiderate. My teenagers struggled badly. International flight need to provide passengers with a little bit of space. Knees should not hit the seat in front. If you are over 65kgs and 165 cms, you are going to HATE HATE HATE this flight. They packed in as many seats as they could. 
To Vietjet- how rude to pack people in so tightly. Please- Open up the space a little. Many Western people are larger than Vietnamese people (written politely). It’s unethical to pack people in so tightly for so many hours. Please be less greedy and think of your customers. Everyone struggled on our flights, the people in front and the people behind. It’s an easy fix, give people enough room to be able sit without hitting the seat in front and then add a little comfort room. 
Also you packed so many people onto the plane, our luggage was not loaded on board despite the paying for luggage. We had just one bag each and you left 2/3 behind! You packed in so many people, you couldn’t take our bags as the plane was too heavy! That’s has to tell you something. It took a day and half to get our bags back and you offered no courier service when they finally arrived in Australia. That’s poor. Greedy. Impolite. Unacceptable. Your fault, your problem and yet not even an apology. We had to drive to the airport to collect our bags. You can’t be unaccountable for such a thing. Again, just 100% greedy. 
Also- You changed our booking twice. Please get your scheduling right and stick to it. 
Your staff didn’t let us keep 100ml of water at the boarding gate despite the sign it saying we could. 
Seperate to the international flights, we paid for nice seats on an internal flight but when we were seated at the far back of the plane when on the ‘new’ flight. No refund for the premium seats which we paid extra for. No refund.  Your system couldn’t recognise we paid extra for seats closer to the front. You stole our money. That’s dishonest. 
As a positive the staff were nice. Toilets clean. Pho was yummy (but we had to pay extra for that). 
Note: you basically have to buy water and food. They give you some food and one very small bottle of water but it’s not close to being enough given the length of the flight. Bring $$ if you are travelling on this flight. Eg you have to buy water. 
So much potential yet so poorly executed.

No information about my luggages at all.I went to the Airport every night to try to pick up my luggages but no good luck. Really shocked with their services. I would never ever take their flight again and won't recommend this flight to any other people at all. 

Besides, their official website and booking system is confusing. Onboard meals are very overpriced and subpar. We couldn't find any real difference between ""deluxe"" and ""normal"" seats. Don't know how much maximum weight our luggages should be.

In brief summary.

Seats are cramped and there is no inflight entertainment.

Onboard meals are very overpriced and subpar.

They replied and advised that they had amended that, which was good. I thought they would have charged my card given that they had my card details and I had given permission. At check-in at Perth airport, they said I had not paid the $45 for the bag for Hanoi-Perth, which I promptly paid. The staff stated that she would give me a written receipt in case of problem at the other end. We had to change to a domestic flight in Ho Chi Minh (HCM), which means we have to take our bags and then check-in again at the domestic terminal. Here, they said I had not paid the $45.  Had to go to another counter to sort this out. After some 15 mins, they advised that it is ok, I could go and check-in, and that they will make sure the system is updated. 

On our return flight from Hanoi, they again said the $45 was outstanding despite me showing the written receipt, and I was asked to go to another counter to sort it out. After 1 hour, in which they had to ring Saigon to clear up the matter, they advised that no, I have to pay for my bag from Hanoi to HCM, as the bag that I paid for is only for HCM to Perth.  I disagreed, as I bought an international ticket, Perth-Hanoi, and Hanoi-Perth and the bags were for these sectors.  As one hour had passed, I was desperate, and asked the staff how much I would have to pay for my bag from Hanoi-HCM.  After 10 mins, the staff came back and said ""it's ok, you don't have to pay anything"".  

Fortunately, we encountered no problem when we checked-in at HCM Airport.  However, we noted on the board that check-in closed 1 hour before flight.  This is an important information for would-be travellers, as the check-in process is often not smooth. We were at the airport 3 hours before flight, and there was already a small queue.  The staff however were not ready until some 20 mins later.

I would say the ground staff at Hanoi Airport are not service oriented.  Overall, VietJet appears to have a poor computer/recording system.

Our flight from Perth to HCM was awful in that the aircon was not working, and it was very warm and unbearable during the 6+ hours flight.  The staff were however friendly.

In contrast, the staff for the flight from HCM to Perth were unfriendly.

Vietjet air has highly comfortable leather seats with an adjustable cushion and reclinable seats. Depending on whether you travel in economy class or business class, the meal was ok ( In economy) however, it was served in a limited amount. Despite the fact that were no sides (side meals), the food contained a small box that could be filled with anything matching your preference such as fried rice (vegan), Basmati rice, sandwich(non- vegetarian) and more. In addition to that, the passenger sitting in the aisle seat will get the narrowest and least legroom which could become a conundrum in longer flights. Although, Vietjet air has meals in limited amount and the aisle seater is given the least possible legroom, I would recommend to go in Vietjet air compared to other budget airlines travelling internationally.

After keeping me on tenter hooks for a whole night and day they notified me after several email requests. I had the responsibility of all my family members, hotel bookings and sightseeing tickets had to be forfeited because of the lousy onward connection endowed upon me. Our whole day was wasted at Hanoi airport waiting for the connection! 
As if that was not enough, they don’t even serve a glass of drinking water on the flight and the crew was utterly rude and mechanical.

My family was across the aisle and the row in front of them had only one person who was sitting by the window. So when they came through with food/drink I asked the flight attendant if I could move in front of my husband into the aisle seat as I was sitting in the aisle seat on my side. Her first response was she'd have to check if someone was sitting there, obviously there wasn't because we had already taken off and it had been empty the whole time. Her next response was they have a buy a seat program and we could look in the magazine to see the prices. I wasn't asking for an upgraded seat just to move across the aisle in a similar seat that I was already seated in and they wanted to charge me. That was a bit ridiculous to me.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bad organization, almost scam-like","It's common for them to just cancel or change your flights, but the problem is if they cancel the flight which was my case, it is company policy to refund the money in company voucher (which doesn't even make sense), and they won't refund all the money either for example, if you paid for additional luggage, according to them that is not refundable (even though they were the ones who cancelled the flight). 
now the company voucher could be useful right? well no, it is only issued months after the cancellation and there if there isn't an alternative flight like my case, you are just stuck with a useless voucher.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't ever FLY VIETJET AIR when you have STOPOVER and CHECKED BAGS,"While we'd appreciate seeing more smiles from VietJet Air staff  (ticket counter, boarding agents, flight attendants...) we are generally OK with VietJet experiences. 
We understand why other reviews are mostly negative and we think they're valid.
The fact that we're not too bothered with these mostly were our personal expectations. 
However, I want to warn other passengers that if your itinerary requires a stop over and you have checked bags, DO NOT FLY VIETJET. 
Apparently, VietJet Air requires its passengers to get the luggage at every stop, then get back to the counter to check in, then go through the security process all over again.  When inquired, VietJet Air ticket agent confirmed that all passengers MUST GO THROUGH this cumbersome, time consuming process at stopovers. 
This is DEFINITELY a DEAL BREAKER for us.
I read everything thoroughly before committing to my purchase, especially when flying. VietJet Air DIDN'T INDICATE that the checked bags must go through above mentioned process. Hence, I purchased their tickets. 

We'll keep this in mind and will NEVER FLY VIETJET AIR if we must transfer with checked bags.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst airline ever,"booked flight Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur via Ho Chi Minh, get a phone call a few days before departure that Ho Chi Minh to Kuala Lumpur flight cancelled and the put me on a flight 2 hours latter. this does not give me enough time to arrange a Vietnam Visa so advise the lady on the phone that I will purchase another airline ticket to get me from HCM to KL and just use the MEL to KL part of the flight otherwise it it alter my schedule to much as the change already meant that I would lose 2 Malaysian domestic flights and did not want any more changes. She advised this would be ok but would receive no refund or credit for the cancelled flight. Went ahead and booked a SQ ticket to Singapore and on to KL as it was the most convenient option.
 Flew from Christchurch to Melbourne to board the VJ flight and told that they would not allow me to leave Melbourne as I did not have a visa, told VJ staff that I did have a flight within 24 hours of arriving but was told as it was not a VJ flight I could not board this flight. Note the VJ rep at Melbourne was not even dressed in VJ uniform was scruffy, Condescending, Threatening and abusive he offered solutions that he then said he couldn't do, advised me that it was my fault for booing an onward flight with another airline etc, After I had advised him that due to his behaviour and attitude maybe I should get the police involved he finally let me on the flight but only if I destroyed my SQ ticket and waited 27 hours at Ho Chi Minh for the next flight. At this stage I felt I had no option. he advised me to go to the VJ transfer Desk for them to hep on arrival.
So I did and they started on me saying I should not be here I do not have a visa etc. trying to explain that all this was due to a flight they cancelled did not seem to be understood. Finally a VJ rep came to speak to me who did not really want to help I explained that i had booked another airline to leave HCM and was told this was not allowed under VJ policy he then stated that VJ would offer US20 as compensation but I would need to stay at the airport overnight and that they would not supply a sleep pod, I am an elderly person and could not cope on an airport chair for that length of time so advised him That US20 was a pathetic amount for an overnight delay at HCM. I asked why I could not use my SQ ticket as the phone rep has OKed it. he finally actually went to SQ check in and talked to them and low and behold turned up with a boarding pass for my SQ flight. took the US20 vouchers from me and let me leave. the only good idea that anyone at VJ showed but this took about 4 hours of my time that i felt imprisoned a HCM airport transfer area without access to a toilet food or water. I did ask for a glass a water but got nothing
Now about the flight itself slow service, poor food and uncomfortable which as a budget airline i may have accepted but due to the stress caused by the incompetent unhelpful and nasty staff i do not want to even give them 1 Star as this was in almost 50 years of international travel the worst flight experience ever thay should not be allowed to fly to Australia as the standard of this airline is disgusting",Date of travel: November 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

1.0 of 5 bubbles,BYO soap and water,"Worst service in 30 years of flying. 

Soon after departure I used a bathroom, but there was no soap. I went to the neighboring bathroom to try to wash my hands there, no soap either. I (I believe calmly) told a hostess that there was no soap, and she had the most blank, almost incredulous look on her face as if I was strange for raising it. No apology, no concern or commitments to get some so the other customers could wash their hands, she just bluntly told me there are other toilets to use. So I went to a third on the other side of the aircraft, no soap there either. In the 4th toilet I found some. I was on the other side of the plane now, so I told another hostess, thinking she might be concerned for others as I was. This second hostess was more polite, but also just looked confused, and didn't do anything about it or apologize either. 

With hundreds of people flying 7-8 hours and eating food you'd think there would be more concern, or just some. 

Some hours later I waited patiently for the food service trolley, and it stopped at the row ahead of me (I was at the back of a section, so I can understand it happens sometimes). So I waited for ten minutes to see if they would return, they didn't, so I pressed the paging button and got the first hostess again.  I explained that the trolley hadn't gone to my row (again calmly) and I would like some food please. Again the same blank face, again no apology. I ordered my food, but she didn't bring the drink I ordered. 

Also at other times the provision of water was very infrequent, and the seat rows are also very cramped. 

It was a cheap flight and they got me there safely, but I will not be back.",Date of travel: November 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

First, Vietjet haven't cancelled its flight like many others that I encountered personally in Europe or Virgin Australia in this same trip. Seat is in 3-3-3 configuration in A330, no smaller than any other established airlines. Their attendants are polite and nice, trying to smile and please everyone, despite the fact that some passengers are abusing the attendant calls. I respect them for that. 
Vietjet does take away water at the gate to Melbourne, but this is the policy from Australia government, not to sell more water onboard, since this did not happen on the trip back to Saigon from Sydney. I trust them on this explanation 
Vietjet is stinky about the weight of carryon, also no IFE, no wifi, no free food or free water. But what do you expect from a budget airline? 
So for people who bad mouth the airline about carryon luggage, free food or water, they should pay more or fly with other airlines.

Despite checking in at the check-in counter, the manager at the gate did not let one of us board the flight due to name details not matching the passport. The booking showed the right details but this manager (Sukanya) just shouted at us that we cannot travel. 

It only took us requesting for solutions till she decided to mention buying another ticket for the same flight (paying double the original price) and not explaining the issue. 

Upon arrival, we approached the ticket office who only redirected us to the call centre with no interest in helping us with the issues we faced and the upcoming flight. 

Close to an hour waiting on hold with the call center, a disinterested and unapologetic customer service representative told us the only way we can board the flight is if we buy a new ticket.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"VietJet cancelled my flight 2 months after booking, refused any refund, rebooked on new airline at considerable expense","Horribly disappointed with VietJet Airlines - if you are traveling in the country as a visitor and looking for any sort of predictability or comfort in your travel plans, I would be wary of booking travel on VietJet and opt for another airline.

I booked a ticket to travel to Vietnam on 23 December in order to spend Christmas Eve with family. 

Almost 2 months later, after booking my ticket, I received an innocuous email informing me that ""Due to flight operation, please check your new itinerary in the attachment.""

The rescheduled booking was for the evening of 24 December - which would force me to miss Christmas Eve with family.

I have now booked another flight on Vietnam Airlines for 23 December at considerable additional expense.

To round out the horrendous situation, VietJet has refused to refund me for my original fare, claiming that the departure is ""only an estimated time"" and cited ""passenger safety"" as the decision to cancel a flight entirely - see below:

""First of all, the departure time on the ticket is only an estimated time, schedules can be subjected to change between the date of publication and the actual date when passengers travel depending on weather conditions or operations at the airport. In this case, your flight was changed due to operations, this is to ensure the safety of passengers.""

VietJet continues only extend a flight credit in exchange for this situation of their own cause. As a visitor to Vietnam, I have no use for this travel credit, resulting in a massive loss of money and a continued drain on my time. 

Reading some of the reviews below, it sounds like people who managed to embark on their VietJet flight experienced no better - would highly recommend that anyone considering a cheaper fare on VietJet think twice unless they are comfortable with ""estimated departures"" leaving 24+ hours later than planned.",Date of travel: November 2023,

I emailed the lost and found desk and within 1 hour they had located my swatch, and given me a form to fill out which would allow them to fly the watch free of charge from Da Nang down to Ho Chi Minh where I would be returning 2 days later. They put the watch on a flight later that same day I left it behind and the rest is history. Went to the lost and found in Ho Chi Minh 2 days later after I landed from Buon Ma Thout and was reunited with my watch.

I did not have a choice of dinner. Any other food required us to pay extra. The only drink we recievd in the 8 hour flight on our ticket was one small bottle of water. No soft drinks or tea or coffee included. A cup of tea was aboit $4.50 AUD. Ive never been on an internatonal 8 hour fight that didnt provide complimentary tea and coffee and adequate water. The food and food service was not adequate for a long flight. I left the plane very thirsty. We could not bring personal water on the flight at all.
The seats were small and not a lot of room. I had pain from the seat and couldnt get in a comfortable position. I am 5 foot 5. 

There was no in flight entertainment. None whatsoever. For 8 hours. 

A good thing was it was on time and a direct flight from Ho Chi Minh to Sydney. 

If would fly with them again only if I could not find any better options.

Clean water is a basic human right & should be available inside all airport terminals & throughout all flights whether domestic or international.
Water was confiscated from me at customs, @ some random security check post customs & at the terminal boarding gate.  No drinkable water was to be found throughout bot Ha Noi & Saigon airports (I found one bottled water outlet in SGN airport & it was empty .. as were the two empty bottles next to it.
Once onboard complimentary water was not available on board the flight.  During my total of over 22hrs in-flight & well over 12hrs in transit at no stage was water made available by VietJet unless paid for in cash. I had left my surplus VND in the charity box so had no cash!!
The airport staff were a disgrace to international flight & domestic flight code of practice.
I would NEVER fly vietjet again, I would never recommend vietjet to anyone & I will be detailing the awfulness of this excuse for an airline to anyone who will listen.
There were so so many issues with this airline.
Briefly:-
#1 .. No soap (or sanitiser) was available in the majority of the lavatories .. both within the airport terminals & inflight
#2 .. connection to all flights (outside of Brisbane) was in non air-conditioned buses - passengers were herded & packed into standing room buses like cattle to the abattoir.  It took 10-15mins on one stage .. with the bus parked on the scorching tarmac ... remember there is no air con & not one person on board had water.
The in-flight safety was not adhered to ..
I saw seats left in recline during landing & take off, bags not stowed under the front seats - major safety issues in the event of evacuation
# 3 .. the staff were at best super slow to answer bell assist .. at worst completely indifferent & ignored bell assist calls
#4 .. grossly understaffed or grossly undertrained cabin staff

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Really Surprised,"Firstly, let me say that I flew Vietjet's Business Class, but the section above only allows me to select Economy.
This was a massive surprise; I took a gamble and selected Vietjet a while ago when they started flying direct from Melbourne to Vietnam.  Fares were very reasonable for 'Business Class' and their Business Class is somewhere between Premium Economy and Business, because they had lie flat beds, but no entertainment system. and you didn't quite have the same room of a Business Class seat.
However, everything about Vietjet Business Class is outstanding!!  The staff service was first class; they had lounges in Melbourne and Vietnam and even though the lounges weren't the same as say Qantas's Lounges, they had everything you needed for a 2 hour or so wait to board your flight.
Service on board is brilliant and I was lucky that the flights outbound and incoming were not full, so I also had a free seat next to me.  Notwithstanding this, Vietjet's Business Class still had plenty of seat/leg room even if the area was full.  Food and drink on board was plentiful and tasty.  Having no entertainment was not a problem; I just loaded up my laptop with a few movies and watched from the laptop.
I would absolutely recommend flying Vietjet's Business Class to Vietnam over say Jetstar's Premium Economy.  It was truly great value for money.

We will not allow you to take these books on the flight.  You have gained 50 kg.  I argued that 500 grams is the weight.  There are books.  etc.  I spoke to the leader of the staff.

I am underweight.  The airline employee who was the leader got angry after hearing this.  He angrily spoke to his sister that you cannot carry other people's weight.  Sister said that I know him.  But the employee continued his speech and insulted the sister.  A student standing far away saw this. He told me that I had also been treated like this and asked me to weigh the laptop too.  Also, since I have a deluxe ticket, I get priority in check in as per rules.  He also refused.  Refusing to allow a writer to carry books weighing 500 grams.

With this minor mistake they did not allow me to board the flight and I had my hotel booking in Phuket which all wasted. I had to book another flight at higher rate for the next morning. They did not even gave me some concession. 
On 23rd October 2023, I was having the same airline flight from Phuket to Bangkok and the crew allowed me to board the flight with the same boarding pass and passport name mismatch. They just simply cut my last name with a pen on the boarding pass and allowed me to board the flight. When it was not such a big issue then why did your crew at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport stop me? Unnecessarily I had to pay for another flight and had to wait for 12 hours at the airport. And the crew was so unsupportive and so rude. There were two girls on duty near the gate on the night of 20th October 2023, flight VZ316, Booking Id 9R85B6. Both of them were not ready to listen to my case.  I was having my hotel booking as well for that night which was all wasted because of your crew. 

Even the customer care service is so bad for this airline. I kept on calling for two days to modify my name for the return flight. First they told me that they can help me with the change of name for an additional fee of 290 THB. Then after sometime they said that we can't help and I have to buy a new ticket. Luckily, I did not buy a new ticket and went with the same ticket and I was able to make it through. It was my hard earned money, why would I waste my money on such a stupid thing which is like a matter of a few seconds for your airline. ",Date of travel: October 2023,

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst airline experience of my life. ,"Imagine you’ve just completed a 26 hour travel day without any issues and finally arrived in Bangkok. You’re only a short one hour flight from your final destination! So exciting! But unfortunately for you, VietJet Air is the only option for your next flight, and they are about to ruin your entire day. It’s 6:45pm and the next flight to Chiang Mai is at 9:30pm. You go to the counter to purchase your ticket. They tell you that even though there are 24 empty VietJet counters occupied by staff, they will not help you purchase a ticket, you have to purchase it online. 

So you attempt to do so, only to find that their abhorrent website will not allow you to make the purchase. It is now 6:50pm (this is important), you go back to the counter for help only for the staff to now inform you that you must be “within 3 hours” to purchase online. No one bothered to tell you this earlier and even though you are 2 hours and 40 mins early for the flight and could be at the gate in 20 mins, the staff REFUSES to give you a ticket even though there are clearly seats still available. So even though you are a 55 min flight from your destination, you now have to get a cab to a hotel and stay the night in Bangkok all because of the horrendous and ridiculous antics of this garbage airline. 

The next morning, you head to the airport very early because you know this airline is awful and likely to cause you even more trouble. You arrive at the counter at 9:30am for your flight that boards at 11:55am. Only for the staff to tell you that now “you’re too early”. You’re either too late or too early for this stupid airline apparently. They tell you to come back at 10:30am. 

At 10:30am you return to the counter, check your bags, and then the staff member says “your gate is very far away, you need to hurry because your flight boards in one hour”. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!? The staff turned me away, made me wait an hour and then told me that I should hurry because I’m running out of time and my gate is very far! 

This is the WORST airline I have ever experienced. I have 3 million social media followers and will be certain to deter them from ever using this airline and it will be the absolute last time I EVER have anything to do with this airline ever again. I would rather pay double that ever see anyone that works at this airline ever again. Also, of course they airline has the worst onboard accommodations as well.

Purchased domestic flights in Australia. Flight was cancelled two days later. They send instructions to get flight credit to re book. The system would not accept our booking  code they sent. Tried emailing them for help and no reply. We decided to book with another airline and seek a refund in Vietnam. Went to office and they refused a money refund. They said their policy did not allow it. I pointed to a section in their policy (11.4) which states that money can be refunded. They said this was not my case. When I asked what case it would apply to they said, ""not mine"". I asked to speak to a manager they said I couldn't because he was working at another office today. I said to call him and they said he could not talk on the phone if he was working from another office. The whole thing was absurd and their policy is to  refuse all refunds and only offer credits, (which their crooked system would not let us do from Australia). They offered us a credit in Vietnam but of course it's all too late and expires after one year -which is useless for international tourists.

I checked-in online, passed the whole process till going to board the plane, queued untill showing the boarding pass and passport, the male staff told me to wait a bit by the side during the queue, I waited patiently until everyone boarded, he looked back at me couple of times and never addressed me until I went back for help cause I was about to miss the plane, they didn't allow me to board the plane because on my boarding pass my name and surname were the same. No solution was given apart from needing to buy another ticket, meanwhile both staff were unhelpful, cold and disrespectful, they also turned away a couple of times to dismiss me while I was being calm and following always their instructions. 

After many hours my solution was to buy another ticket from a different airline.

With all this I wasted my money with your Vietjet ticket, spent 95$ extra for another ticket, lost 5+ hours and felt treated like a robot by robots, I've never seen or been treated like this during many years of traveling. ",Date of travel: August 2023,

Good:
- Departed on time.
- Seat space enough. My husband is a big guy and he finds the seat was ok. He said much spacious than JetStar.
- no free drink. No entertainment service. You need to pay for food. We knew these in advance. We chose LCC. Less services are acceptable.
Not good:
- you need money to book a seat regardless of row or position. We thought basic seats are free ( or I should say the cost was included in the flight ticket) this was cheating.
- couldn’t know if we could completed online check in completely. We thought we successfully did half a day before but found we didn’t when we arrived AP. Online check in web sites need to be improved for simpler operations.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,It's a low cost airline. Just add chickens.,"Brisbane to HCM return. Economy - deluxe. I paid extra for the better seats. The seats there were front row, back a few rows in. It came with a meal too. 
On board - the seating plan was a lie. There were three rows in front. For extra money, once onboard, you could take those empty seats. Our ""better"" seats were narrow. Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable. It was bearable. Just. I hate misleading advertising though. 
Meal. Despite having paid extra, we were amongst the last on the plane to be served. They start at the front but only serve one side - all the way to the back and then all the way back down. By the time they got back to us, the choices were diminished, the food cold (some people asked them to reheat it but I didn't mind), and we were hungry. 
We got there - it was fine. 
On the way back - no drinks allowed past the final flight check in. I know this is standard but still find it bizarre - if you can buy it airside... 🤷 Anyway, no water available in the overcrowded holding pen - not to buy, not to fill a bottle. None. Onboard, the already delayed flight was delayed even more when a passenger changed their mind and wanted to get off. I understand why they wanted to - I was losing the plot with all the noise - HEY VIETJETAIR! THAT SONG ON REPEAT - ForFlipFiddles! TURN IT DOWN!!!! On top of the one song on repeat for an hour at way too high a volume, there was a screaming child, people listening to their devices without headphones...it was hell. I have no qualms with the flight delay - it was beyond their control. That we didn't get water until 3 hours after boarding! That I have a problem with. I got a bottle with my vile meal (I couldn't eat it) and bought another bottle. No complimentary water for 9 hours. How is it legal? It's not like you can bring your own. 
The ""better comfort"" seats were terrible, the noise was insufferable, the cabin lit like a shopping mall the entire flight so the screaming kid stayed awake...I felt like I was in a movie of an overcrowded boat full of people, cows and chickens. It was just bonkers. It made me feel like I never want to travel again. 

I would recommend VieJetAir, yes. But just pay the extra for the business or skyboss seats. They are still the price of a normal seat on a regular airline, and let's be real, all airlines are a bit disappointing these days.

On our Vietnam round trip we flew with this airline from Hue to Hanoi. Check-in was smooth, we were told we could take our two-year-old daughter's pram on board as hand luggage.

At boarding, we were then held up by a very unfriendly airline employee. She told us that the pram was not the right size and would not fit in the designated compartment. We kindly referred to the statement at check-in and to the fact that we had already put the pram in the compartment several times on flights and therefore assumed that it would also fit on this flight. The employee insisted on her opinion and said we should wait for her boss. So we stood away from the queue for several minutes with our crying daughter in our arms, with one passenger after the next boarding the plane. The employee was not bothered by the fact that our daughter was crying either. On the contrary, I had the feeling she even liked it. After the boss came, we had to go to the security check again with the pram. There, a member of staff gave her permission for the pram to be taken onto the plane.

In the end, we were allowed to take the pram on board and - what a miracle - it also fit into the storage compartment.

To say something good: The flight itself was quiet and very pleasant.

In my opinion, this is not the way to deal with travelling families with small children. I have never experienced anything like this on a flight with my daughter and would definitely not fly with this airline again.

Our flight from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh was delayed 6 hours. Plus arriving early for the international airport check in times. We sat in the airport for close to 9 hours. Once we boarded the plane we sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. The pilot kept coming over the intercom blaming Sydney airport, then changing his tone saying it was Vietjets fault for poor logistics. It was all very strange. We were given a $15 food voucher for our troubles. The plane itself is very run down, poor facilities and the staff don’t really care about customer service. My seat was ripped with the upholstery in terrible condition. We were missed twice for beverages. I had to get up and walk to the back of the plane to purchase a bottle of water. They told me they had sold out of water? And offered ice tea instead. There are no air vents about your head, along with no button to ask for the flight attendant. This is a very budget airline, I thought Tiger was bad but this airline is worse. Once we got to Vietnam the pilot told us to fill out the online form for compensation for the lengthy delays. I am still going back and forth over emails with Vietjet for compensation which I doubt I’ll ever receive. I won’t ever fly with them again, lesson learnt. Definitely get what you pay for!

It is THE WORST AIRLINE I have ever encountered in Asia.,"I have frequently used budget airlines, which generally maintain a reasonable level of quality and offer friendly and professional service. However, Vietjet does not meet these standards.

I was deeply offended during a recent experience at the check-in desk in Terminal 4 at Changi Airport. While the other check-in desks, managed by Indian staff, were courteous, the person at the Vietjet desk, who was not of Indian ethnicity, was extremely rude. He made derogatory comments about my appearance, insisting that my passport photo did not resemble me because of my longer hair and glasses, whereas the photo showed me with short hair and no glasses. To make matters worse, he even showed my passport to his colleagues, mocking me and asking, ""How can she claim to be the same person?""

Such behavior is unacceptable and disrespectful, especially considering I was a paying customer. I have traveled to Singapore numerous times before, and my passport photo has never caused any issues when entering the country or other nations. Moreover, in the event of any doubts about my identity, the immigration office is capable of making an appropriate judgment.

Regrettably, I have had multiple negative experiences with Vietjet. However, on specific occasions when Scoot didn't have available flights or when other airlines were fully booked during urgent travel needs, I had no alternative but to use Vietjet's services.",Date of travel: June 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

We had originally booked via AirAsia website and when contacted them we were advised of fees to change even thou we pointed to the policy that changes were free. Turns out Airasia act as agent and charge their own frees on top, so need to contact airline directly to make free changes, which we did

When at airport, at 9am, we were advised our 11:20 flight was cancelled, so we had not been informed about one of the changes and we were booked on flight at 2:40pm and not 11:20am

We asked to speak to manager who came over and spoke very moody and angry with us, to point it really annoyed us

Her attitude was so bad, refused to do anything, saying earlier flights were all fully booked.

When we asked to speak to. Next manager she refused advising she was most senior person. .

After a stand off at the checking desk were we refused to move until she called someone who could behave more professional and act with customer service in mind, she finally made a call to someone.

We were not allowed to speak to that person, but we were then offered either refund it flight 1hr earlier as earlier morning flight was fully booked

I filed a report at the VietjetAir desk at the airport immediately and provided them with pictures and all required information. They advised me to email customer service the following day, which I did. They have been giving me the run around for almost 10 weeks, then today I received an email notifying me that they are not taking any responsibility for my lost luggage, stating some BS: ""Dear Passenger,

First of all, we do apologize for the late response. We escalated your case booking number SJAGH5 immediately after receiving your email to the relevant department and all concerned. After we have checked from both the departure and arrival stations including CCTV record, we found no lost baggage case. All baggage from flight VZ721 PNH-BKK on 14 May 2023 completely arrived at the arrival station. In addition, there was no baggage left behind at the baggage carousel according to the CCTV.

However, we regret to inform you that this does not fall into the condition to provide the compensation.

We do apologize for the inconvenience.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,DON'T EVER FLY VIETJET,"WORST AIRLINE, SCAMMERS

VietJet Airlines is absolutely trash and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone! Sure it is cheap which may be tempting but the quality and service is not worth it at all.
My uncle arrived to Australia from Vietnam to realise that his checked-in suitcase did not. He only had 1 suitcase with all his belongings, and arrived in FREEZING Melbourne with NOTHING. 

After 1 week of no contact from the airport or airline, we had to make an international call to VietJet, in which they told us it was the airports responsibility. We had already contacted our airport and they had done everything they could from their end and concluded that it is an issue with VietJet. I proceeded to ask for some sort of compensation as it had already been 1 week without any belongings for my uncle who had to buy everything just to get by. We were told by one of their agents to wait another 3-5 days as they opened the case and investigated. 

Another 7 days passed and we continued to have NO contact from them. Again we had to make another call and explain our situation, this time we were told by another agent that we would have to wait ANOTHER 7 days for them to find the lost suitcase and before they can give us any form of compensation. Making it 3 weeks since his arrival to Melbourne. I found it ridiculous to have no contact for them and that we have to wait 3 weeks in total for any sort of compensation? They had no progress on the whereabouts of this suitcase and failed to provide basic customer service of updating their customers.

By week 3, we still had no contact from them and had to make another call. This time, they asked us to wait ANOTHER 2 WEEKS for any sort of compensation.  So making it 5 weeks in total. The waiting period of compensation on a suitcase that we checked in and gave them the responsibility to is absolutely ridiculous. 

On the 5th week, we again, had to call them to find any sort of update regarding this suitcase. Another couple of hours on the phone and the customer service people of Vietjet could not tell us a single thing apart from that we just had to wait. They could not give us a time frame of how much longer we had to wait, even though it had already been 5 weeks. I again asked for some sort of compensation as it had been so long, staff had no clue what their policy was and I had to refer them to their delayed/ lost baggages policy that was on their website. I was eventually transferred to their team leader who also had no clue what their policy was and was of no help. Only after hours of arguing did they finally agree to give me a time frame and acknowledge their policy. 

A WHOLE 7 WEEKS later, we finally received a phone call from Melbourne Airport stating that the suitcase was found. They also did not offer us delivery service and we had to make the long trip to collect the suitcase ourselves.

My uncle had no belongings during his whole holiday here in Melbourne. A holiday is mean’t to be relaxing but because of VietJets negligence and poor values, he had a horrible time. VietJet’s policy states that customers are entitled to compensation for delayed baggages. A policy that I had to explain to the VietJet agents who I called over and over again. None of these VietJet workers had any clue of their OWN policy and could not give us a valid reason as to why we had to wait so long for compensation that is rightfully ours. 

We even attempted to buy more baggage for the return flight and the website did not allow it. We found the correct website but when we put it in to purchase, we were unable to. We attempted to make ANOTHER international call to purchase more baggage and they were unable to help us. 

Their website, planes, customer service by their airport staff and helpline staff, policies, attempting to buy add-ons, and pretty much EVERYTHING ELSE is absolutely TRASH, I can not say a single good thing about this experience with VietJet.
Their policy is a LIE, this airline is a SCAM. Do not trust them with anything. They will not help you and continue to drag you on and deny you your rights.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst airline experience ever.,"Understanding that weather delays are out of the control of an airline, the true mark of an airline is how they manage any delay. We don't know if our delays were weather related because the airline didn't give us any information...

Though the flights from Sydney to Hanoi were bad: Sitting on the plane in Sydney airport for an HOUR, plus further unexplained delays, the flight back was actually the worst flight ever. 

A one hour delay turned into a FIVE HOUR delay. The airline would not open for baggage handling through much of this so I was dragging all my luggage with me. There was no explanation for the delays, just the occasional announcement that it was going to be even later.

When we finally boarded we were SPRAYED, then sat again for a half hour before takeoff. The Hanoi -ho chi min city leg is suppose to be an hour 45 yet we were in a holding pattern over ho chi min for an hour and 20 mins. 

The connecting flight was delayed from 730 to midnight... When it finally landed in Sydney, there was no GATE available so we sat on the plane for over an hour...

1.0 of 5 bubbles,A Gut-Wrenching Review: Vietjet Airline's Ruthless Customer Service,"I recently had the misfortune of dealing with Vietjet Airline, and let me tell you, it was an experience that left me feeling utterly disgusted and violated. Their appalling customer service, combined with their complete lack of empathy and refusal to rectify their own mistakes, has compelled me to write this brutally honest review. Buckle up, folks, because this is going to be a wild ride.

My nightmare began when I booked a flight through Vietjet Airline's website. After completing the transaction and receiving my booking confirmation, I was horrified to discover that the system had issued the wrong ticket date. Realizing this error within a mere 30 minutes, I immediately contacted the airline in the hopes of resolving the matter without any hassle. Little did I know that I was about to embark on a journey through the depths of customer service hell.

Upon reaching out to Vietjet Airline's customer service department, I was greeted by a representative who seemed disinterested and unhelpful from the get-go. I explained the situation calmly, hoping for a prompt resolution. However, instead of acknowledging their error and offering a solution, I was met with pure arrogance. The representative simply refused to change the flight date without imposing a hefty fee, as if it was my fault that their system had malfunctioned.

But that's not where the horror ends. In an astonishing display of disregard for customer satisfaction, the representative then put me on hold and left me waiting for over an excruciating hour and twenty minutes. Yes, you read that right—over an hour and twenty minutes. During this agonizing wait, I was subjected to a cacophony of repetitive hold music and intermittent interruptions of a pre-recorded voice repeating how important my call was to them. It was a blatant lie, and I felt my blood boil with each passing minute.

Finally, when the representative returned, their attitude had not changed one bit. They offered no apology for the extended wait time or the inconvenience caused. Instead, they continued to stonewall any attempt at a resolution, refusing to take responsibility for their own mistake and insisting on charging me an exorbitant fee to correct it.

I cannot stress enough the sheer audacity and cruelty displayed by Vietjet Airline throughout this entire ordeal. Their lack of professionalism, empathy, and accountability is simply staggering. As a customer, I was treated as nothing more than an inconvenience—a mere cog in their profit-driven machine.

To say that I am appalled and disgusted by the treatment I received would be an understatement. Vietjet Airline's complete disregard for customer satisfaction and refusal to rectify their own errors without imposing unjust fees is a testament to their blatant disregard for basic decency.

If you value your time, money, and sanity, I implore you to steer clear of Vietjet Airline. Save yourself from the agony, frustration, and heartache that I endured. There are plenty of other airlines out there that prioritize their customers and treat them with the respect they deserve. Vietjet Airline, on the other hand, is a despicable entity that has no place in the realm of aviation.

I flew VietJet air - Bali - Delhi 3 days ago and I am still recovering from the trauma of the nightmare the flight was. I cannot blame the airline for the crying babies, But certainly can for not letting me change my seat to ANYU empty seat (I am not referring to the XL seats) On both my flights - the crew denied me the basic right to change my seat once the boarding was complete and there were plenty of empty seats. Apparently, you have to pay to change your seat. Even if you are moving to the last row (no reclining). I went ahead and changed my seat anyway, there was no way I was spending such a long journey next to CRYING babies.  So anyway, it hurt the ego of the staff so much, that they refused to SERVE ME FOOD. Yes you heard it right, they went right past me and started collecting trash and I kept wondering why I am not getting served? So I went ahead and questioned a crew member to which she responded ""You changed your seat, we went to your seat and it was empty"" Are you kidding me????? I said you literally just went past me. She said ""we will wait for all passengers to get through, then we will make an announcement for you, you can come and claim your food"" Yes. these were the repeated words of ALL THE CREW MEMBERS! This is after a 3 hour delay, no food all day and two long flights. I was starving and had to practically scream, shout and finally BEG for food. I reached for the food myself eventually, and they started calling the captain as though I was committing a felony. I was simply asking for FOOD and the crew members were enjoying ""punishing"" and ""torturing"" me and depriving me of my basic right. Anyway, eventually, they gave me whatever food they had. Didn't even bother to ask me my PREFERENCE. When I asked the staff for non veg meal (Basic again) she responded saying "" WE ONLY SERVE VEGETARIAN FOOD TO INDIANS"" I mean seriously????????????? This is pure harassment.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst ever flight,"We travelled from Mumbai to Bali via Vietjet. It was one stop flight, the stop was at vietnam. We selected that flight because it had a shortest layover between two flights, only 1.5 hours.
NO Legroom:
We booked XL seats, My both son are 6 feet tall. So I needed Bigger legroom seats. We paid extra while booking tickets for the XL seats, thinking that we will get enough legroom. But when we reached to our seats, there was not enough legroom between seats in the XL seats, We felt that we wasted our money.  
While booking in each flights first 4 rows were not available to book. We were in the 5th row. While asking for the first empty 4 rows in the flight - ""First 4 rows we reserved for the crew members"" the staff informed. Seats they were keeping empty. And giving those seats to people with cash, so We felt cheated cause we tried to buy front first row seats while booking from website, and we got no legroom seats even after spending so many, and they were selling those seat on site.
Don't buy food:
Food and water we have to buy in USD. Food tastes worst. 
Racism: 
There we local Vietnamese people on flight. The staff were allowing one or two of them to seat in the front rows, which we paid for those, and in one flight, even one staff asked my son to move from his seat, so that one Vietnamese girl can sleep properly. 
I would recommend to never travel via Vietjet, unless it's an life and death emergency.

I took this flight to return to Japan from Thailand. It was a late night flight, so the seats in the back were rattled, about 5 rows on both side.
I asked the flight staff if I could move it if no one was using it, and they said as long as it was after takeoff.
In fact, when I moved after takeoff, I was told, ""No, this row is not available,"" and ""Well, what about another row?"" I asked, but they said ""No”.
I had no choice but to go back, but another person moved to an empty seat without asking the staff, occupied a row, and started to lie down.
The seat I was once told was no good was also occupied by another Westerner who had eventually moved seats and was sleeping on the seat. And they said nothing to those people.

I didn't particularly ask them to do anything unreasonable, but this was a level of response that made me wonder if this was discrimination against Asians or discrimination against women.

タイから日本に帰国する際に利用しました。
深夜便だったので後ろの座席は5列程度ガラガラでした。フライトスタッフに「誰も利用者がいないなら移動してもいいか」と聞くと、離陸した後であればとのことだった。
実際離陸した後に移動すると「この列は使えないからダメだ」と。じゃぁこっちの席は？と聞いても「ここもダメだ」と。
仕方なく戻ったが、別の人はスタッフに聞きもせず勝手に空席に移動し、一列占領して横になり始めた。
私が一度移動してダメだと言われた席も、結局座席を移動してきた別の欧米系の人が横になって寝ていた。その人たちには何も言わない。

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Know what you're getting yourself into,"We ended up flying on this airline as part of a package deal from a travel website. I have not flown on discount airlines before, so I was not really sure how bad things would get, but they were worse than I expected. 

The check-in agent at Incheon seemed to have very little understanding of her own company's policies or what was shown on the company's website, leading to a long and frustrating debate over checked baggage fees, which I'll explain below. This echoes other sentiments about staff being poorly trained.

And as you expect, be prepared to pay for everything and anything. On one of our flights, our row was full but there was an empty row a few rows ahead of us. I asked the flight attendant if we could move and he said we'd have to pay to change our seat. This wasn't an issue of moving up a class or anything like that, it was just for moving into another row. I asked him (in English) if this was some sort of extortion racket and he actually answered ""yes"". I don't know whether he misunderstood my sarcasm or was being brutally honest with me.

Here's my advice should you have the misfortune of finding yourself booked on this airline:

1. Pay for your check-in baggage in advance. The website shows different fees for baggage up to 20kg, 30kg, etc. Weigh your bag and pay before you head to the airport. We made the mistake of not doing that and had a 26kg bag, figuring we'd pay the same 30kg price quoted on the website. Wrong. We were told that 20kg is the limit, and we'd have to pay around $10USD/kg beyond that, so what would have been around $30USD if we had paid in advance ended up being like $100USD. 

Then, once we moved 6kg of stuff into my carry-on bag, we were told that we could not pay for the check-in bag at the counter, but rather had to go to the customer service desk, where we were then told that the only payment options were cash or a wire transfer, and not a credit card. Then they gave us a receipt and we had to go back to the check-in agent.

2. Bring cash. Should you find yourself wanting anything on the flight -- like wanting to change your seat! -- you will need to pay cash for it. Although we were traveling from Korea to Vietnam, I actually heard the flight attendants quoting prices in USD, though it seemed that they were accepting Vietnamese and Korean currencies (though at less than favorable exchange rates). 

3. Prepare to be uncomfortable. I am 5'8""/174cm so not tall by any stretch, and yet I felt that I had almost no legroom whatsoever. Anyone much taller than me would be super uncomfortable. 

4. Lower your expectations. Aside from everything above, I'm sure I'm forgetting stuff! So your experience will probably be worse than you think it will....",Date of travel: June 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"
1.0 of 5 bubbles,disgusting airline ,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown with, hands down. Absolute nightmare from start to finish. Customer experience was appalling it’s almost laughable (but not really, because they find a way to squeeze you out of more money whenever possible). 

When I recently flew with Viet Jet, they never announced our flight was boarding even though we’d been sitting near the gate for 2 hrs and it would’ve been impossible to miss an announcement. When we went to go check what was going on, they told us boarding had already finished and that we couldn’t get on our plane. The plane had 15 mins before it was even supposed to leave. The airline staff screwed over several of us this way and forced us to reschedule our tickets for the next day, of course after paying a fee. Initially they said it was 1 million VND per person, but they hiked up the price at the ticket counter to 1.25 million. We told them that’s not what we were told and eventually we only paid 1 million VND p/p, but this poor elderly gentlemen was forced to pay 1.25 million VND. 

Never again will I fly with Viet Jet. Yes the prices are cheap, but is your mental health and happiness worth the sacrifice? I’m screenshotting my own review to remind myself how horrible this airline is. Textbook example of a trash airline. And, the actual flight experience was horrible.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,DO NOT EVER TRAVEL BY THIS AIRLINE,"I plan on writing this review on every possible platform/ website. Vietjet is one of the worst airlines ever. 
First experience was when we took a flight from Danang to Ho chi Minh in Vietnam. 
They delayed the flight from 7.30 PM to 12.00 Am with prior notice of only one hr delay. 
They changed the gate 5 mins before boarding the flight and when you go ask them about anything, they pretend to be clueless. 
I have never experienced such a snob staff who refused to answer questions for their customers. 
They pretend to not understand the language. but if you work at an airport and deal with International customers every day how do you not know the English language ?
Also they took more than one hr to get the bag on the belt after we landed in Ho Chi Minh. 

anyway moving on to the next flight. From Ho Chi Minh to Delhi. This experience was even worse than the last one. 

The attendant on the check in counter asked us to weigh our entire baggage including the laptop bags. She didnt care to explain anything properly. She kept on making faces at us because again she pretended to not understand. She sent one of our check-in baggage which had almost 2 Kgs left to fill and later on just handed extra baggage form for our Laptop bag + Cabin Bag. To finally which we complained but again she kept on making faces and there was one other flight attendant who was capable of understanding our problem. 
but they purposely made us talk to the other one. This all chaos took us 40 Mins at the check in counter. 

She didn't let us buy a seat with extra legroom. There were more than enough seats on the plane as we could see after boarding. 

In-flight when we asked the attendant that if my husband who had actually bought the extra leg room seat to move near my seat from back to front at the similar paid seat since it was empty, she just mentioned NO I CANNOT, UNDERSTAND. 

Their service towards their customers is really really bad. They make the whole trip experience sour for you. They have no etiquette towards customer dealing or for that matter, explaining or even talking to the customer for them is like a task.

this airline is to be avoided at any cost!!!!  singapore staff of vietjet is terrible
1) the online check in said was successfull but once arrived at the airport they say it was not done
2) the staff at the counter was absolutely unfriendly and refused to do the check in  for me despite I had no luggage to check in as they say i should be 50minutes in advance for this (and i was exactly 50minutes in advance when i asked for their help!!), but they already closed the counter since 51minutes before the boarding.. so there are lying.
3) I had to boucht a second ticket and even with that i was able to reach the gate of the vietjet plane before it closed... so without the zeale from the ground staff I could have get my boardng pass normally
4) their customer support dont answer to any of my queries calls or emails and use excuses when i finally reached one of them
5) they didnt provide any support, goodwill, voucher or anything

1.0 of 5 bubbles,You have to do better Vietjet,"Ok first thing that happened is I forgot to place my middle name on the booking (my mistake). Since I did this this cost 220VND to correct by the VietJet employee. That seems like a problem because it is a simple change in the computer. Behind me were two other people paying the same fee. Second came the bags, I booked through JustFly.com. And it stated on booking that first checked bag is free. Vietjet stated that isn’t what it said in their system. I showed them the booking and they said it had to show in their system. So I paid another 638VND. Contacted JustFly.com, they stated it was gisrst bag free for each ticket, which is consistent with booking confirmation and clearly stated on email from JustFly.com which I showed VietJet? 

The customer service is non-exsistent with this company and the inability to logically address processes and problems is also non-exsistent. 

It makes no sense to go pay 220VND to simply have booking changed by another VietJet employee. And the ability not to read and handle a bag that was paid for in the booking, that clearly states on the booking is ludicrous. In the end it is not a lot of money and I was here in plenty of time for the flight which is currently delayed 1.5 hours. But why nickel and dime the customer for a clearly paid for service or a simple customer interaction.",Date of travel: June 2023,

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Consider the full cost and not the price... WORST Customer Service,"I usually never post public feedback on companies but I had such a terrible experience with VietJetAir that I would like you be aware from what you should expect… (FYI I am a frequent traveler with a 1k Premier status on United Airlines).

While on vacation with everything planned to the tie - Our flight (Da Lat -> Da Nang) got canceled last minute without any notification from them. We showed up at the airport and went straight to their counter to find a solution… the rep tried 
to the minimum to find a solution, keeping repeating “send an email to the client service” without trying to find a solution right now… it led us to book a flight with Vietnam Airlines (which I highly recommend) with a layover to Ho Chi Minh. After my disappointed 
interaction with the VietJetAir rep I immediately filled the refund request (because obviously they would NOT reimburse me even though THEY canceled their flight and move to a random day - so their fault not mine) and confirm that I wanted a refund. Anyways 
few days later I wrote back to the customer rep asking where my refund was… and they said I did not click on the click to confirm the refund while I filled the refund request - INSANE.

Bottom line… while VietJetAir is really competitive to book a ticket to let yourself caught up on the price of the ticket… consider the FULL cost of what you pay (On-time departure, solid customer support, inflight service, and quality of the 
service). If you travel in Vietnam and if you have a scheduled plan, please consider another company.

I check in a few weeks,turns out I was approved but they didn't notify me. By this time the opportunity to pay is long gone

Fast forward two weeks for another flight with the same company, we enter into check in for our flight. The desk workers proceeded to ask us to wait on the side. We waited for 10 minutes without any communication , then were asked to weigh our carry ons, which we figured okay that’s fine, we should be under the weight limit for two. Which we were, as one was overweighted and another was underweighted so it balances out. But then we were asked to weigh our backpacks. Which is the first time I and my partner had ever been asked to weigh it. Since my backpack is usually heavy with my laptop we went over by a lot of kilograms. We were not communicated to earlier at the check in desk that our back packs would be weighed so we would know prior to boarding. At check in desk nothing was said until boarding. We were then charged 3.6 Million VND ( 132 Euros) for going over around 6 kilograms.

They rescheduled the flight (from 18:45) to the last flight of the day (22:20) , which means you’ll arrive the next day, so we miss our connecting bus. While they were earlier flights possible according to their website. 

So we decided to go directly to the airport to change the flight. The lady behind the customer “service” was really rude and not helping at all. I’ve been trying to explain to her flights are available on the website, however she didn’t want to change it.. she even suggested to book it on the website… so I have to pay twice.

I demanded to speak to her supervisor and she told me to call the helpdesk, of the number which doesn’t work for me. As I told her I’m not going to leave the desk, she decided to leave the desk, which a queue and do something else..

After a few minutes another lady, who was sitting next to her, said out of nowhere, I’ve booked you and your girlfriend to the earliest flight, which is 20:15. Was that so hard? lol

I'd heard that Vietjet didn't even serve drinking water for free, but was surprised that they do. So thank you for that, Vietjet. They serve water in paper cups, but you might have to buy bottles if you want extra.
Food was pathetic! I can't put this in a nicer way; We got basmati rice and some curry, and paratha with malai kofta (or at least that was what it was claimed to be). The parathas were soggy and tastless. The kofta balls tasted like boiled mud. The FAs don't accept USD bills that they ""don't like"" or think ""are old""!

The passenger who has the Vietnamese name was forced to pay, while a US passenger with the similar middle name and first name arrangement was not fined.
Why is their policy different from what they requested on line?

First, be careful when you fill in your information. I don't know if this is a purposeful trick or a language issue, but I was asked to fill in my Middle name and then my first name. When I finally received my itinerary, I noticed that my middle name was in the spot for my first name. I contacted them immediately and even though this was their fault, I had to pay a fee. 

Then, I noticed that they charge for everything including water. So I got a meal for my departing flight, and thought I can book my return flight meal later. Wrong. You have to book the meal 18 hours in advance or you have to pay for an overly expensive meal on the plane (if they have any leftover).

They also don't allow you to check in online, unless you're going to very specific destinations. Want to make sure you're not stuck in the middle seat? Pay more money online. 

Considering there's even less leg space than other budget airlines in flying in, I wanted to make sure I could check in and pick a seat. They would charge us for air if they legally could.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Wrecked my vacation by changing the flight departure time,"I had a 4-day trip planned from Saigon to Ko Phi Phi island. Understanding that it takes time to transfer from the airport to the island (2-3 hours), I was careful to consult the ferry times to ensure I had adequate time to travel between the island and the airport. AFTER arriving on Ko Phi Phi, I received an email telling me that my return flight was being moved up by an hour and half, from 13:25 to 11:55. This change in departure time now meant that I couldn’t get from the island to the airport in sufficient time to check in on the morning I planned to leave the island. So I had to check out one day earlier, lose what I had paid on the room, leave the island, and then pay for a second hotel on the mainland. This is not how I planned to spend my 4-day vacation from work.

I should also add that they moved up the departure time for my departing flight, as well. Also by an hour and a half. The flight was initially 10:30 and was changed to 09:00. And then, based on delays at the airport, we did not leave until 10:00.

VietJet does not understand or care that travellers make arrangements for their trips based on the published timetables of various modes of transportation. It is ignorant of them to disregard the needs of their travellers by changing the times of their flights at the last minute for operational reasons. Particularly when their flights are NON-REFUNDABLE.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,There's a serious top down problem.,"Let me start off by complimenting a flight attendant named Simon who went out of his way to do what he could to make us comfortable but if not for him, I would have to say this was the worst flying experience my wife and I have ever had. 

First was the weighing of the carrying on bags. We were 10kg underweight with our check-in but 5kg over in our carry on (an issue I'll never understand because it all goes on the same plane). No problem though, shuffled some weight around and off we went. We got stopped again later to weigh our carry on once more before we got on the flight and they still said we were over weighted. They also were unhappy I was carrying my coat in an extra bag which they viewed as addition carry on. This went back and forth before they eventually conceded. Over the course of check in two other families also got into shouting matches with staff over trivial matters that I believe were probably enforced on staff by higher management. 

They overfilled the bus bringing us to the plane too so much so that people had to hold their carry on over their heads to make room thus preventing them from holding onto anything and so had to just bump against each other as the bus moved. They also left us standing like this for an additional 5 minutes at the plane while waiting for another vehicle with only 2 passengers on it to board first. 

On a 5 hour flight they also provided no complimentary water and not just that, the water they were selling was 3 USD per bottle! And it was a 330ml bottle too! We had no USD and no Dong left so were unable to purchase. 5 hour flight with no water is really poor form. 

I know they're a budget airline but this was made for a really unpleasant experience and secured me as a guarantee non-return customer.",Date of travel: March 2023,
4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Decent and acceptable flight, no negative surprises","We recently booked flights on Vietjet with itinerary Mumbai - Danang - Hanoi - Mumbai.

Just before booking, I read the reviews here and honestly had second thoughts about the flights (and hence our Vietnam trip). This was more so since we were flying with 2 small kids - a three year old and a one year old - besides 3 adults.

We did go ahead though I booked our tickers via a travel agent to have some kind of support in case of complications. 

I must say that the entire experience was entirely fine. 

Vietjet is a low cost airline and you can expect a similar experience to an Indigo. Keeping that in mind, let me address the recurring points one reads on TripAdvisor.

1. All our flights were quite full and took off more or less on time - no cancellations or undue delays.

2. We did not have any issue with check-in luggage weight or hand bags. We were allowed 4 bags of 20 kg each and we had 3 bags of 25 kg each and it was perfectly fine. Our hand luggage was not weighed or sized and I saw several people with large carry ons. In fact they allowed us to take our strollers as carry on while Indian Airlines usually don't. 

I feel that many people who have issues with luggage allowance may have booked the lowest fare which clearly indicates only carry on. 

Or they try and check in too much weight, which indeed Vietjet may be strict about. But honestly excess baggage is pretty cheap on Vietjet, especially if booked in advance.

In fact, our luggage appeared very quickly on the belt in Hanoi (on the domestic sector) and there were not many suitcases - a clear indication that people book the lowest fares generally.

3. Yes, the legroom is not great but it's a short flight and honestly any domestic Indian traveler is used to the legroom you get here.

4. We received a meal and a bottle of water (maybe because we booked through an agent). However you can easily buy water on the plane and you can get free glasses of water in the aft section if you need.

5. The staff was friendly enough, maybe a bit curt but that seems to be the Vietnam way anyhow.

6. There were no queues at all while checking in in both Hanoi and Danang and modest lines in Mumbai. It all went pretty smoothly. And Hanoi international is a calm and efficient airport as well.

All in all I have no hesitation to recommend Vietjet to anyone flying Mumbai-Vietnam, given our experience in March 2023.

2 practical tips:
- sometimes the payment for addl services doesn't work on the mobile app or site but somehow does work on the desktop site. 

- for Indian travelers - suggest you take USD cash and exchange it in the local market (not at the airport) into VND. The INR VND rates are very bad both in India and while using your credit card.",Date of travel: March 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

normally i won't leave a message of my complain even if i am dissatisfied. But i would feel sorry for myself, when i don`t tell you about my worst flight trip in my whole life. In all these years  when i went on a plane, i have never experienced something that outrageous like the flight on your plane. It was in the middle of the night when we started our flght in your plane. Even though it was in the middle of the night, all the lights on your plane were turned on. Normal flight companies would turn off or dim the light so the passengers on the flight could rest and take a sleep. But all your lights were turned on. And to make it even worse, the stewardesses on the plane started to sell us stuff with a flashlight, to secure that we won`t be able to sleep.

I really have never experienced a worse flight than with your flight company and would never ever book a flight with your flight agency again.

I recommend you to think about your passengers first before you try to use your passengers health to make a profit out of it.

1. check in process, ahmedabad airport - superb
2. check in process hanoi - took us 120 mins to check in a group of 10 
3. Language is an issue - understandable but complete apathy and uncooperativeness of check in staff at hanoi airport was simply intolerable
4. i think somehow it has been engrained in the onboard service staff that being rude to passengers is the best way to control them.
5. we asked for hot water in a cup, which was denied as they are instructed not to serve hot water, but hot black coffee is ok to serve. 
6 the meal served on board was not edible even by the lowest of low standard.
7. the staff did not show courtesy to even old people by offering one free glass of water - most inhuman 
8. i can understand maximising revenue and encourage sales of water, but not accepting any currency but VND for purchase is also ridiculous. 
9. i have travelled many no frill low cost carriers, but this must be the first time i did not have the urge to even thank the crew on board my flight, as the attitude was just completely pathetic towards, passengers and especially old people. i would recommend not taking any flight on viet jet air. how ever convenient the connection and price. just not worth it!",Date of travel: March 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

Most of the sickness was caused by the poor hygiene standards on the vietjet flights. The bathroom did not have toilet paper from the start of the flight, so customers were using the sink paper towels to wipe — the paper towels were located by the sink, so this had caused streaking of fecal matter across the wall/under the sink area of the vietjet flight. The vietjet flight shares 2 bathrooms for business class, economy, and the cabin crew, so everyone was sharing these fecal matter/no toilet paper bathrooms. 

Business class included a free meal, and I had made the mistake of accepting a free meal. I should have known if the cabin crew were using the same bathrooms that were shared across the flight, there would have been no way for them to clean/wash their hands properly, as the bathrooms had fecal matter all over the paper towel area and the wall under the sink area. 

I was infected by food poisoning/e-coli due to improper food preparation by the cabin crew (most likely fecal matter touching the food prepared).

And I put my Galaxy Tab A8 in front of the seat of me because I thought it's easy for us not to stand up and keep the bag up.
After the plane landed, we let people get off first because we were sitting in the very back. So we have to be careful to hold our bag up in case other passengers take the wrong bag.
We are very careful to get our bag when it is our turn. We ended up not putting our Galaxy Tab in our bag and leaving it unattended on the front seat.
When we arrived home, we realized that our Galaxy Tab had been forgotten on the plane. We tried to call but could not reach all numbers, email no response, call to VIETJET Singapore no response to any other of our communication to report the missing tablet, only email After 1 week we found the number to report the lost and found tablet but the staff only asked us to stay on the line for 5 minutes and it ended without us talking to any of the staff. I try to reach them but still no one answers the phone. After a few weeks I found another number and tried calling again, this time she asked the same questions? (why did not she contact me earlier)

I thought if I call earlier they will give me my tablet back, if I call late they may have the tablet GONE WITH THE STAFFS!
When I inquired, she told me they found the charger on December 19 and 21, but no trace of my missing tablet.

In the meantime, they only found the following:

 FOUND THOSE NO VALUE ITEMS AND 
 
 NOT FOUND THOSE VALUE ITEMS
 
 I can say with certainty that the VJ staff used my Galaxy Tab. The reason for this is, first, the staff checked the seat immediately after I left it, and I believe that's the protocol.
Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, I am sitting in the back seat and I am the last passenger. This is the first time I have ever left my stuff on the plane. I just think that I will get my bill back safely because I left it on the plane and not on the Vietnamese street.

Rude and always up for a discussion. We were flying with a baby strawler which is fit for hand luggage as it folds completely. They didn’t believe us in Bangkok even when we explained that we just came from chiang mai and it had the vietjet carry on label. 
We had to take the baby out and fold it in front of them as proof. I mean it’s not easy to keep a baby quiet so I protested and said let the cabin crew deal with that because I will have to fold it there anyway. 
No Mr. Fold it now or you won’t get a boarding pass. 

Very unhappy we arrive at the gate and every other airline, including vietjet at all other airports, give priority to families with babies when it comes to boarding. 

Well not the Bangkok crew!! They said go stand in line this is vietjet we are a low cost airline no priority. I explained that this is not a matter of buying priority seats. Even the priority seats at the gate show that families with babies fall in this category. 
Anyway a big f*ck you from them resulted in standing in line with a tired baby.

I booked my return flight of Delhi - Phu Quoc in August and travel was in January and it just cost me around Rs.11500 per person for return flight... after reading several reviews and newspaper articles I was worried too.. but this airline didn't let me down ..

The staff was courteous in the flight too...

At the time of security check my 7 yr old son met the pilot of our flight and asked him to see the cockpit.The pilot was so amazing that before taking off he specially came searching my child and took him to the cockpit..That memory of my child will be with him forever....

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pleasantly Surprised,"Having read other stories and reviews,   I was dreading the flight, especially as I had arranged connecting transport  out if Hanoi upon arrival and accommodation.

The staff were quick,  efficient and pleasant right from check-in throughout. 

Prior to boarding they identified me and asked if I needed boarding assistance. 

The attendant insisted that she place my pack in the overhead locker.

Staff followed pre-takeoff safety protocols and, as I had arranged mobility assistance with my previous carrier to make sure I didn't miss my connection, the VietJet staff made a point of checking if I needed help upon arrival at Hanoi,  directed me to the nearest bathroom, invited me to use the call button for extra support  at any time,  and when the flight landed,  they asked again if I would like assistance with the stairs. 

The flight departed on time and arrived early

The captain demonstrated appropriate duty of care in activating the seat belt sign and recording in a timely way when  we encountered turbulence. 

The seats on the plane were basic vinyl but not at all uncomfortable, and legroom was better than on a Jetstar flight I took to Perth last August. 

The in flight menu was not great,  but perfectly adequate for this short flight.

The only reason I didn't rate this a 10 is that, while staff  were fine and helpful,  there was no announcement regarding available services throughout the flight,  and so passengers were a little in the dark as to whether to wait for a service  (e.g. food), or jump in and ask.

If my flight experience is indicative of Viet Jet's current performance,  they must have responded to previous reviews in the magnitude of 1000% .  

Based on this VJ998 flight, I would have no hesitation in using them as a budget carrier in the future.   In fact I am due to for my return flight at the end of the month,  so we'll see how things go then.",Date of travel: January 2023,

I don't normally fly with low cost airlines but was impressed.,"I booked a same day last minute flight one way from Nha Trang to HCMC in Vietnam.  I am not keen on these low budget airlines but had no choice last minute.  Not sure how I did it as the price was cheap but I booked a SkyBoss seat which is business class.  Off to a bad start when I get an email an hour later telling me that the flight is delayed by around 45 minutes due to operational issues.  After checking in and getting ready to board, the plane was further delayed by another 35 minutes.  Not too bad but still.  I am told this is normal!  Checking in was quick.  You can only check in 2 hours before departure for domestic flights.  Staff are pleasant and friendly.  My business class ticket included check in luggage and it came out first as priority after we landed.  You get access to a lounge with free food and drinks plus wifi that did not work!  At Nha Trang airport, you have a bus that drives you to the plane.  The business class passengers (5 of us including myself) were driven separately to the plane from the other passengers and seated at the front.  Spacious with more leg room.  As the flight was less than an hour, we were only given a complimentary drink but could order food which was also available on the standard class.  There is a menu.  I didn't check prices but there was a big range of noodles, drinks, snacks and more.  Nobody bothered on a 45 minute flight.  No inflight entertainment, but as I said this was a short flight.  Planes were reasonably clean.  Cabin crew were friendly and nice.  I wish they would be more stricter however, with security and safety.  Seatbelts were not checked nor did they bother telling people when bags were not correctly put under the seat or in the overhead compartments.  Getting off the plane was quick.  Once boarded, we took off quite quickly too.  Arriving in HCMC we did have to wait nearly 25 minutes before they started to offload our bags.  This wasn't the airlines fault as the airport was busy and a number of other planes had landed before us.  Generally good.  I was impressed.

She started shouting at me across the desk - 'no visa no fly' over and over again. 

Eventually I got the home office website up on my phone and translated it into Vietnamese so she could read it. I think she was embarrassed by her mistake and started shouting at me again ""I can deny flight"" over and over again. Eventually, she printed out my boarding card, stuck it in my passport and actually threw them at me over the desk. I was absolutely shocked. 

Fortunately, I was able to keep my cool as if I had raised my voice she surely would have refused my flight. I know they are a cheap airline - but is it worth it to be treated like that! Of course, immigration both at Vietnam and Thailand were absolutely fine and I went through with no problem.

Then, I landed in Vietnam and pushed to get more assistance at the counter and this time they could not refuse to assist me. Eventually, after two weeks, I received an email back from a customer service representative telling me that it would cost me $9 FOR THEM TO FIX THE NAME ON THE DUPLICATED RESERVATION AND ANOTHER $36 TO GET A CREDIT SHELL ON A $111 TICKET. THEY REFUSED TO REFUND THE MONEY ON A DUPLICATED RESERVATION THAT THEIR WEBSITE MADE. 

Then, when I got to the counter the next morning, the service agent and manager were extremely rude and insisted that I have a K-ETA to get on the flight and were not going to let me board the flight.

Here is my feedback on horrific  experiences of my journey to a wonderful destination:

1. Cabin Space : Extremely cramped , forget about sleeping , you can not even sit properly. Eating food you need to master an art of  pushing  it into your mouth without spilling  on your shirt / pant 

2. On line booking of extra services : For my onward journey , I paid money to book better seat online and they denied upfront at check in counter , they never refunded me any money - While colored Robbers . While returning home I did not take any chance 

3. Food : My company booked meals on both flights , the meal was really hot & spicy ( even by Indian standard ) and it was Mini skull in quantity and horrible in test . When you order food you get water bottle complimentary , no other drink like coffee etc. 

4. Air Condition : It was extremely hot inside  cabin during onward journey to Ho Chi Minh and in the return journey it was freezing cold . Flight attendants did not bother to respond to my request to adjust temperature of cabin 

5. Landing : Horrible to say the least , I seriously doubt the flying skills of pilots as in both the cases planes were banged on run way not landed . Two straight horrendous experiences in my 25 years of flying history

6. Ground service : Pathetic in Ho Chi Minh City and non existent  in Mumbai

7. Refund Policy: What is that ???

8. In flight infotainment : You please carry your own iPAD , iPOD etc with your own noise cancellation head phone please , as this is alien terrain for this pre historic air lines

The only reason why this flight may still remain in operation - (until off course their own pilots break the landing gear of their planes)  is due to fact that it's probably the only carrier running non-stop flight from Mumbai to Ho Chi Minh City and this flight is not operated on all days of the week..

1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst experience I’ve had with any airline over the world,"We had a flight at 3:35pm from Chaing Mai to Bangkok with Vietjet, we then had a connecting flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui with Bangkok airways 4 hours later, which allowed us plenty of time. The first flight they delayed to 4:15pm two days before departure but it was ok because we could still make it. Two hours before the flight they rescheduled it again to 4:55pm, which wouldn’t allow us much time but we were assured it would be fine. When we drop our baggage off we’re told it won’t be rescheduled again so it will be fine, probably not even 15 minutes later it was rescheduled to 5:20pm. There was no way we would get our second flight. We went back downstairs to where we checked in and asked what they could do for us. The woman said she’d move us to the front of the plane so we could get out sooner and separate our bags in the hold so they would come out first. We leave this counter and go to Bangkok airways and ask if there’s anything they could do regarding the second flight and they say they can move us onto the latest flight they had which was 40 minutes later than the one we booked for 3200 baht which is about £75. We had already paid a lot for these flights so we weren’t happy about having to pay an extra chunk for the same flight a little bit later. We then go back upstairs to our gate (which was moved from gate 3 to gate 4 to gate 12 in the space of an hour). It gets to 5:20pm and we’ve still not even boarded the plane. 5:35pm we’re boarding but the plane doesn’t set off until 6pm!!! We were also on row 9 even though there were 4 free rows at the front, we had to ask the flight attendants to move us to the front because the woman at the desk didn’t end up doing it. The baggage drop off for our next flight closed at 7:05pm so we were sure we weren’t going to make it. We land at 7pm and the plane is driving around the tarmac for 10 MINUTES trying to find a place to park up. The doors open and we ran as fast as we could to the baggage claim which was 1KM AWAY. My partner waited at baggage claim to grab the bags and I ran upstairs to the check in desk to see if I could hold it open. The woman at check in said they can hold it for 6 minutes longer and I was so grateful. My partner messages me from baggage claim saying the bags still aren’t coming out and we have 3 minutes until check in closes at this point. The woman at the desk calls down to baggage claim for me and she says the bags won’t be coming out for another 5 minutes so she agrees to keep the check on desk open for another 15 minutes for us. Long story short the bags didn’t end up coming out for another 30 minutes and we miss bag drop. I go back downstairs and the bags finally start coming out. Our bags came out LAST!!!!! At this point I was frantic and on the verge of tears. We grab the bags and decide to try our luck getting on the plane anyway as we had checked in online. We run through security and they take all my liquids even though the bags would go in the hold anyway as they were big bags. So now I’ve lost out on even more money. We get through security and run down the gate and they’re boarding the Koh samui flight, we get to the front and they say we’ve missed our flight it left 5 minutes ago, this is a different flight. At this point I’m crying to the woman asking if we can get on this flight but she apologised and said it was fully booked. We had to wait until 5am the next morning to get a new flight at 7:30am. Worst experience I’ve ever had at the airport and won’t ever book with vietjet again. If I could rate it less than 1 I would.

They cancelled our first flight with less than 10 mins to boarding which was delayed by 6+ hours. We had a connection flight back home through Bangkok which we never made because the 2nd flight we were moved to (which was the last flight out to Bangkok) boarded all of the passengers and then realized they overbooked the flight by 1 person and then cancelled the flight because the airport and runway had closed. It was 1230am and everyone was left scrambling to try and rebook flights.  It was a hassle to get hotel vouchers from them and we didn't know when the shuttle bus would pick us up in the morning. The hotel was far and by time we reached and got our room it was after 3am and we had to be up for 5am because we were told the first flight was at 730am which we were all booked on. When I called the airline they told us there was no 730am flight and that it was at 950am. 2 different airline representatives gave us conflicting times for when the shuttle bus would pick us up at the hotel, and we were left with a window of 6am to 8am (even though most people were ready for 5am).

Having read the reviews, we were a bit concerned but should not have been. Looking at the complaints, I think it is a cultural issue. People from countries where rules are flexible like India seem to struggle with low cost carriers, whereas those from more rule bound places are ok. Just remember the low cost business model - low fare but they aim to get extra money from you. So don’t think you will sneak on extra luggage or check in more than your allowance. Plan ahead. We knew one of our bags was overweight so we paid ḏ160k for more kgs. If you want food, take it with you.

The flight itself was fine. Standard Airbus seating and we had an exit row which was included in the deluxe price. The staff were polite but the female uniforms are somewhat misogynistic in my opinion!

The plane was only slightly late and the bags came off fast.

While travelling from Delhi to Vietnam, we faced problem of staff refusing to consider one small spelling mistake in the visa of one of the traveller of our group, though Visa was issued  by Vietnam Immigration Department and for correcting the same he was charged Rs. 1400/-, which a person was compelled to pay to avoid cancellation of the trip. Then despite issuance of Visa of another traveller, she was being refused travel on the ground that at the time of her return few days lesser that 6 months to expiry of passport will be there!! However, this was supposed to be checked while issuing the Visa by the Immigration Department itself.
 
During return journey, they charged huge amount for the excess luggage for the food articles, which were purchased from the Duty Free Store of their own airport & they didn’t allow even small packed water bottle to be carried in the flight, which was purchased from airport only. This was probably to compel a passenger to purchase water or food in the flight, as not even a single glass/ bottle of water was not being provided free of cost even when the flight time is of 5 to 6 hours.  Then despite the fact that more than 70% of the travellers were Indian, neither staff were trained in speaking English atleast, nor there was any provision made for sale of Indian or vegan cuisine.

Unfortunately, staff of the airlines were also very Rude too such an extent that these extortion charges were being collected at the eleventh hour, so that the passenger shall have no other option than to pay money demanded by them. Not only this, while flight landed at Delhi airport, an old lady passenger fallen down due to some fits or attack but despite passengers shouting for help, staff was preferring to be either sleeping or being mute spectator. 
 
Then every time it was noticed that firstly there is a delay in arrival of the luggage of passengers and the complaints of few of the passengers about non arrival of their luggage, was simply falling to the deaf ears of the staff. 
 
Many of the passenger have taken videos of such unruly behaviour of the staff of the Airlines.

one the worst airline to fly with.

1. They don't even provide free water and they charge USD 3 for small water bottle. No credit card is accepted for payment instead you have to pay in USD (they dont have change for large bills) or Vietnam currency.

2. Web check in does not work. When you ask them to assign seats together at the time of check in they answer flight is full and system assign seat numbers. They can't change it.

3. When you transit via Vietnam agent will approach large group and then start weighing cabin luggage. what's the point of checking cabin luggage at transit stop over and not at the check in counter. Even many folks were trapped to pay for excess luggage when they had purchased duty free from Vietnam . So they are trying to make extra money with cabin luggage charges and give cheaper ticket upfront.
Avoid this airline flying to Bali. Many travel agents will push this because tickets are cheap.

4. They handle your check Inn luggage in worst way and many passengers found their baggages brocken on belt. The ground staff is also so rude and non responsible and even their manager at airport didn't want to take responsibility of brocken luggage and not offer any help.

I had a flight from HYD-DPS. They cancelled it 12 days prior to the trip and dont have any proper customer care in India. After hours and hours of communication with them they finally rescheduled it from Mumbai.
Further, just before 3hrs of the scheduled flight from BOM they changed my ticket date from 26th to 27th with 3 hours notice. What is surprising is that my connecting vietjet flight is still 26th. They expect me to time travel and catch up my connecting flight??. 
Anyways i reached airport and got to know the flight was delayed for 4hrs and during that time after a lot of back and forth they changed it back to 26th and i was able to board.
It gave me a lot of mental stress!! Even the reason vietjet people give for delay is that it is a low cost airline and we shouldn't have high expectations out of it. 
They dont give meals and even water we need to purchase during the flight. The seats ar super uncomfortable.

In our situation, we decided to book with VjA because the airline offered an earlier flight. We booked last minute so Bamboo and VNA sold out of their early flights. When we booked online, we chose flight departing 10:15am then the airline delayed it twice to 11:55am then again 12:30pm. When we arrived at the gate, there were lines of people waiting to board our flight. VJA refused to let anyone on board explaining there was a technical issue with filling the gas tank. There were elderlies, pregnant customers and families with small kids all waiting to board. Some screamed and yelled “VJA is such a scam, making us wait from 7am until now (12:45pm)”, some asked to speak with their management, some even livestreamed on facebook with an attempt to show the public how rotten this airline is.  We travelled with 2 kids so we went online and booked another VNA flight to the same destination. Wasted 200$ for this terrible airline is a lesson well learnt. Never again VietjetAjr! 

You may luck out flying on time with VJA but 90% of the time they are late or delay or cancelled. And they wont refund your money. Such a waste of time! This airline needs to go bankrupt soon.

We had selected our choice of seats while booking our tickets and even paid for the same. We also pre booked our meals on the flight.

There was absolutely no intimation of the change of seats and also no refund of the money charged to us!

I was told since there is a change in aircraft the earlier seats are not available. On making some noise and threatening to escalate the matter, we were given alternate seats which were similar to the ones we had pre booked!

Just shows that either the airline is clueless on how to run itself or is simply trying its luck at hoodwinking passengers! Only when someone raises a hue and cry on the seats being changed will they actually offer you what you paid for!

I will say, with learned bias, that VietJet Airlines is a cruel joke for the unaware. In comparison to other S.E. Asian airlines, VietJet pails in comfort, on time departure & most importantly customer service. 
VietJet comfort: thin padded seats, narrow legroom. People with a low centerline gravity will have problems. 
VietJet customer service:  my latest & will be the LAST TIME I've flown VietJet was from Saigon to Bali, flight VJ897, 11:35am departure. I paid the additional fees for my checked baggage... the problem was just before the moment of a late departure. 
My check- in was early. By the time of my late departure there had been 3 gate revisions. The fun was about to begin.. I'm thinking the late departures was because VietJet was running their asses off between gates with portable scales in toe. My jet was allowed to takeoff after every suspicious carry- on was checked for weight. I was 'doubled billed $95.95 for excess carry- on weight. Now mind you, my air ticket, no baggage was actually cheaper than $95.95. I could have bought a cheap seat for my carry- on & my carry- on's carryon if that did not exceed 7kgs. 
(VietJet later refunded that $ portion of the incorrect  charge). 
In looking back on my VietJet events of that day in Saigon, I'm thinking VietJet found a way to add additional revenue to their coffers. My personal impression was as watching a vulture waiting their time. The VietJet personnel were coldly efficient & unabashedly ruthless, like this is our business to poach your monies. 
Added note: I offered  to take my computer out of my carry- on but was informed that was not about to be. In addition, they took my camera bag & added that wait. Gotcha!

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Terrible experience, Inhospitable staff, Scamster airline","Have had the most terrible flying experience with Viet Jet.

1. The crew did not even serve water on the aircraft. In spite of having meals included in our ticket, we were not provided with the meals and were offered a glass of water to complement. The staff did not help, cooperate and had no answers as to why the meals weren't provided for.

2. Scamster: We had a layover in Vietnam for the Viet Jet connecting flight to Bali. They charged us for the hand luggage while re-boarding at layover port (Vietnam). We were allowed to carry the same hand luggage while our first boarding at Mumbai airport with the same airlines. At Vietnam (Layover port), just before exiting the boarding gates, the staff had our hand luggage weighed. Our hand luggage was 1 kg extra than the prescribed limit, which we then reduced by trashing some food items. They created this whole scene where they didn't understand our language (English) properly and as if the bus to the flight will leave us at the port if we do not pay the extra charges without considering the reduced weight. They did not even have enough change to the dollars we offered and compelled us to swipe our card to their specified/filled-in amount.
Being in a foreign land, there's nothing much we could do. Though we tried to fight for our point, it was in vain.

It was a perfectly planned scam by Viet Jet staff, to have the weighing machine placed right before boarding and create a tense environment compelling the foreign tourist to only agree to their terms.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible airline. Over 2 hours wait. No explanation.,"This has to be THE WORST airline I’ve ever used, and I’ve flown with EasyJet. Firstly, the flight was delayed by 1 hour and 5 minutes, no explanation given, no announcement made. 

Then, there was a further delay of another 50 minutes before we could even queue up to board. 

We were crammed into a bus, a worrying amount of people placed on this bus, which drove very jerky. It then stopped at the plane and kept us all on the bus with the doors closed for 12 minutes, which doesn’t sound like a long time but when you’re crammed in like sardines just looking at your plane, it is. 

Finally, we get on the plane over 2 hours after we were meant to have taken off. 

We were then told we would be delayed further due to weather conditions, so that’s now 3 hours.

 We then sat there for 45 minutes waiting to take off.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Stunning Incompetence,"This is clearly the worst airline in Vietnam, if not on the entire planet. How can people with no interest in aviation, to say nothing of customer service, run an airline? My theory is that their entire fleet consists of a single plane that flies haphazardly around the country. I was notified by text the day before, twice, that our flight had been delayed a half-hour each time, only to arrive at the airport to end up being delayed for 2 MORE HOURS, longer in fact than the actual flight from Haiphong to Phu Quoc. During this time, zero counter personnel were to be seen (I'd have been hiding too). There were 2 announcements during this entire time, over the loudspeakers, moving boarding from Gate 4 to Gate 6 and then moving from Gate 6 to Gate 4. When I finally saw the counter staff woman, she deliberately ignored me before walking away. Even the normally patient and stoic Vietnamese, who must be used to this kind of thing, were shaking their heads in disbelief. Judging from the actions of many upon boarding, it is my guess that many were flying for the very first time. I tried calling their 'customer service hotline' twice. Do you think that call was answered? If you guessed 'no' you would be correct.  When we boarded, not even a cursory apology for our mass inconvenience was offered, though they were more than happy to sell a bottle of plain water for 30,000 VND, as well as instant noodles for those who wanted them. Not sure how much these racketeers were charging for those. We arrived in Phu Quoc at 10 pm, 3 hours after our scheduled arrival, therefore much too late to get dinner outside of the extortionate hotel room service. Need I mention that our trip from Saigon to Haiphong was also delayed for an hour without explanation, or that by the time you pay the extra baggage (7 kg + !) surcharge, you're better off avoiding this airline like the proverbial plague and just flying Vietnam Airlines. I'm from the U.S. and thought I was was accustomed to bad customer service and corporate greed and stupidity (Yes, I'm talking about United), but this was a new low.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Never again. Avoid at all costs,"While traveling through Vietnam, my husband and I used Vietjet for the hour flight from Da Nang to Nha Trang. ""For that price it's only an hour, how bad could it be,"" we thought? Well it was all pretty bad. Boarding felt disorganized. The flight was late departing with zero mention of it while sitting on board waiting to take off. We were forced to check our carry on suitcases due to the weight limit. In doing so, they totally ruined my luggage! When we picked it up from the carousel it was missing an entire wheel where the outer shell had broken off, and then had several other cracks throughout! So now we wait for someone to take a report. They finally do after about 10 minutes of waiting. Then they walk us out of the secure area to the Vietjet customer service desk and hand the representatives behind the desk the report. 

The reps tell us they can compensate us with the equivalent of only $6 USD because it's ""only a broken wheel."" I argued that is not sufficient. The entire suitcase had been ruined. What wheel was broken? There was no wheel there to be broken, it just gone! We showed them the other cracks to the shell but they refused. We asked them to provide us a place then that would repair the suitcase for us for what they are offering and she couldn't find any place that would. So we asked for a supervisor. This was denied. No one ever came. I tried calling their customer service # while standing there and nothing. Emailed them while there and got an automated reply that they'd get back to me as soon as possible. Think I ever heard from them again? Nope! After standing at the desk over an hour and being led to believe the woman there was working in a way to help us, she eventually started eating her lunch and stopped acknowledging us completely after saying there's nothing else she could do. It was the $6 or nothing. When a 2nd rep finally appeared and we explained the situation and showed her it was more than ""just a wheel"" she radioed for the person that wrote the report to come back out. They showed her the additional tears. She updated the report to reflect ""broken shell"" from their list of damages, which provided us a few extra dollars. At that point we gave up and accepted the equivalent of barely $10 USD.

I called and emailed follow ups to my initial contact on the 17th every day that we were in Nha Trang. It is now the 24th and still nothing. We've contacted them on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) as well in efforts to at least get a reply of some sort. I've never experienced such a total lack of customer service. We can't even call it bad service because it's more like nonexistent.  The combination of all of it makes me passionately say that it's best to avoid this airline at all costs. They're not worth it.

Not one staff member helped us find oversize baggage drop off or take us through an express line at security, or offer a buggy towards the gate.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst Airline I've Ever Flown on!! AVOID!!,"I was filtering through my email and found an old correspondence with Vietjet Airlines back in 2018 and all of my anger came flooding back. (It's been 4 years). 

---- BOOKING EXPERIENCE ----
I purchased a ticket through them online and they sent me an email back saying that the suspected fraudulent activities. They asked me to provide my first 6 digits and last 4 digits of my 16 digit credit card and a photo of my passport. 

I have worked at the bank for 4 years and never have I ever heard of a third party needing to verify fraudulent activities on a credit card. I never received any phone calls or emails from my own bank who ACTUALLY has access to my banking statement. As well, I don't see a need to send in a photo of my passport via email when there is no way to digitally verify whether my passport is legitimate. They wouldn't accept just my passport number and expiration date like any other air company. 

If I didn't know any better, I most likely could have been scammed with identity fraud. If not identity fraud, this was overall a poor customer experience. Why need to go through the hoops if you didn't collect my information in the initial purchase in the first place? 

After a few email correspondence of me pushing for a reason to show sensitive information online, they said I could show my passport at the check-in counter. ???

---PRE-FLIGHT EXPERIENCE---
The booking experience should have been a red flag. I went to the check-in counter to show my passport. I lined up for 40 minutes so I could get to the counter. Once it was my turn, the staff turned me away to a different counter (even though I was originally told to go to the check-in counter). I went to the second counter and they told me to go back to the first counter i was already lined up at. 

I refused to move. I wasn't going to wait another 40 minutes. I demanded to see a manager. They hesitated, I had to talk to speak to a number of staff members who passed themselves off to their other colleagues. The thing that I remembered the most was that I could barely understand their Vietnamese OR English. I am fluent/native in both languages.

When I couldn't understand their Vietnamese, I asked them to speak louder. They wouldn't, so I told them to speak in English. They tried to speak in English but I could barely understand anything. Anther note about myself is that I worked with older Vietnamese people in my country who have low commanding in English. I am familiar with what Viet-lish can sound like. It was as if everybody was purposely trying to be inaudible to waste my time. 

I don't remember how things got resolved. I either frustrated the staff so much that they lead me forward or I had to pay an extra fee. Otherwise, will NEVER go on this flight again.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Unsympathetic staff and non-communicative staff,"Most of the features of the airline are pretty common to most other budget airlines in terms of scumminess. 

What stands out for me and my experience was the unsympathetic borderline condescending/rude attitude of the staff.

The feeling is instead of the airline working with you, being on your team, to facilitate and help you be on your way to your destination as efficiently as possible without any delay or hidden issue, there's rather a sense of intentional omission of important details and policies which conveniently always cost the customer money, and thinly disguised joy when the customer is found in breach or error of something, like a sales person making a commission. Like the food and drink on their in-flight service - it's how they make their money. 

Whereas the more expensive airlines make a bit more of an effort to inform the customer of all policies and procedures so as to avoid any issues. 

Notice, that when they're late, when they underperform or miss a detail when they fail on their service provision, customers are supposed to cop it without compensation. There's hardly an apology, there's no sincerity or care.

But when it's the other way around, the customer bears all the costs. 

So when they can't even pretend to care about their customers, it's difficult to pretend to care about or prefer them over any other scummy budget airline.

At a certain point, the money saved dealing with such budget-orientated organizations just isn't worth it, and the first time is the last time you use such a service, you just go back to paying normal prices for the major airlines and get treated a bit more like a human being.",Date of travel: June 2022,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

Our whole trip is ruined because of this, because the airline wants to consolidate all passengers from different trips across the day so save cost and increase revenue. Such a awful way to do business.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Really helpful in person - just don't rely on their social/phone contacts...,"I recently flew from Hanoi to Da Nang and back with VietJet Air. I'd had a recent fall in Hanoi and was on crutches, so I tried to call their online contact centre to notify them that I might need wheelchair assistance (which needs to be done with at least 24 hours to go before the flight). I tried in excess of 10 times throughout the day and was unable to get through. Therefore, I messaged them over Facebook (and also asked if they could advise why I was unable to check-in online). 

They took days to reply, by which point we had already flown to Da Nang. The staff at the airport, however, offered me a wheelchair straight away upon seeing my crutches and helped guide me onto the plane as best they could.

For our flight home, I once again tried calling the helpline regarding my need for a wheelchair and our inability to check in. Once again, no answer. I then messaged them via Facebook again (hoping for a speedier reply). I got a speedier reply, but the reply just told me I needed to call them 24 hours before the flight and therefore they couldn't give me a wheelchair. Well, I HAD called them 24 hours before my flight but they had not answered. Their online agents are incredibly unhelpful, and going even the slightest bit out of their way seems like a chore. They really need to work on this (as well as increasing the amount of call operators they have) if they want to improve their reputation.

When we got to the airport ready for our flight home, I was once again impressed by the kindness and attentiveness of the in-person airport staff. Even though they had not had 24 hours notice (because I couldn't get through the phone lines), they immediately gave me a wheelchair, arranged wheelchair assistance through the airport, helped me onto the plane and arranged a wheelchair lift to help get me off the plane too. A kind VietJet Air young man then wheeled me outside, and even spoke on the phone to the Vietnamese driver waiting for us so to find out where he was parked.

I happened to buy a ticket under my married name but I brought with me my ID with my maiden name.

They said the rule was that they could only accept physical evidence, not photographs and that I had to buy a new ticket. So I asked them to refund the ticket that was purchased and I was willing to pay the fee for having to refund the ticket. Do you know what they said to me? They couldn't refund me anything because the ticket was incomplete!. I couldn't believe it. The airline just make up the rule to keep the customer's money even though the seat was now available for them to sell again. They wanted to double the money on one seat.

To add salt to the wound, I ended up buying a new ticket at almost double the price of the original ticket because to them I was now buying a late ticket. Where is the sense of right and wrong? I had to buy 2 tickets for 1 seat. This airline is evil and corrupt. I could see the supervisor I talked was gleeful through his pretense at politeness that he was making more money for the airline on his shift.

I saw many people getting to the front of the machine queue only to encounter an error and be forced to queue again for the check-in desks. The check-in queue was going taking ages and there were lot of passengers in danger of missing their flights. 

The reason the queue was moving so slowly is that most passengers were being charged for overweight carry on luggage. Also there was a constant stream of passengers whose flights were almost leaving that were rushed to the front. Apparently there was still time to charge those passengers for the few kilos they were overweight. My bag was about 2kg over the allowed 7kg and I was charged (only the second time in my life as a frequent traveler). I wouldn't mind on a normal day, as it is their policy, but when it was so busy they should prioritise getting people through the check-in process than pinching pennies on overweight luggage. 

In my couple of hours queueing I witnessed tears, anger & frustration. Three times security had to be called because outbursts and there was one passenger barred from flying.

On the date of travelling, I came to the airport before the departure time 2 hours, but I have to wait in the long quete and suddendly the staff at the check-in counter said that my name was totally wrong (just because of typo). She asked me to go to the ticket information point for supports, I came there at around 9.45am, the staff said that maybe I will be late (the flight will take off at 10.25am), she refused to support me to correct the name on ticket and asked me to buy a new ticket for ""6 times"" the prices and plus VND 193.000 for 20kg check-in baggage. I have to wait and change to travel in the afternoon.  

The staff's attitude is so deplorable , they don't care what professional and good service are. The schedule of flight started at 2.55pm but the staff came at 2.50, ignore long long queue of customer waited in front of procedure point to get on the plain, he steped leisurely ... so then the plain took off at 3.30pm. WTF

In the afternoon, I arrived to the travelling destination, I came to the ticket information point and asked for supports to change the name on my ticket for the return side. And then... I have to pay another fee for typo mistake with the price of VND 397.000 and additional fee incured depends on the ticket price fluctuation (why?why? and why?), I did not have any information about this information (two airports have operated with different ways and different price level...). In additional, again and again I did pay additional fee for check-in baggage with the price of VND 248.000.

Then, all caucasians in the boarding queue were pulled aside and issued large over-weight carry-on baggage charges for very minor differences.
I was not allowed to take anything out of my bag. Pay or no flight.
After a heated discussion with staff who are so rude they shouldn't work anywhere near cudtomer service, i gave in and handed my card.
I said just a second, i need to unblock the payment with my phone. They ignored my request, swiped the card and it declined (as i said it would if they don't give me a second to unblock it).
Then they refused me boarding, the flight left, the staff left and i was stranded the wrong side of immigration.
When i managed to get stamped back through after explaining the situation to an immigration officer i had to visit another incredibly rude vietjet staff member to reschedule for the next day and pay a fee equivalent to a new flight.
The reason for reschedule on my new ticket was 'late arrival'!

1. First flight was about a year ago - from Hanoi to Shenzen. I was planning on using a visa-free transit (holding a train ticket for onwards journey to Hong Kong). I found 2 sources on the internet suggesting that this journey is possible without a visa. Unfortunately, I was refused boarding (the airline insisted that onward train ticket doesn't qualify for this visa exemption). My Chinese teacher later contacted Chinese officials who confirmed that the train ticket qualifies. I lost money and had to change my plans. 
2. Second flight was around the same time - from Hanoi to Taipei - no problems this time.
3. Third trip was a return trip from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Both flights that we initially booked were cancelled and they moved us to different flights (on the same days as booked). I understand rescheduling occasionally happens, but it looks like it's a common practice for VietJet, because my girlfriend had a similar experience with them on another occasion. They didn't handle it very well too. When cancellation happens - AirAsia sends an email with options including changing the flight or getting a refund. VietJet just sent us a new itinerary without asking if it fits our plans. Also - we had to buy extra luggage on our return flight - they were very meticulous when checking the weight.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Pay peanuts ... get monkeys,"As Pandemic strikes, Bangkok Airways only flies one return flight a day from BKK to HKT , the only option to do a same day return trip from Suvarnabhumi airport is Thai Viet Jet.

Thai airways is a bit uncertain in these troubled bankruptcy proceedings times.

I did it three times in this past month and it is bad. Planes are ok - new A321 or 319. Some even with electrical outlets.

Plane were all on time. Hard not to be with so few planes flying. 

Had to take a bus in all BKK boardings and once out of three in Phuket.

Many people took off their masks in the plane and attendants said nothing. In fact flight attendants when going up or down the aisle look at their feet. Not at what is going on in the plane - a fine way to avoid confrontations.

On my flight last evening a French man sitting behind me kept on coughing with his mask around his neck and the lady he was travelling with was screaming, speaking loud to him with her mask down her neck too.

Disembarkation was a mockery of the social distancing requested by the crew. 
The announcement read by the crew to request diembarking 2 rows at a time is poorly redacted. It puts the emphasis on taking one’s personal belonging rather than on asking for sequential departure from the plane.

So, every time we disembarked it was a mockery of social distancing. It would take a flight attendant at the emergency exit (mid plane row 14) to tell passengers to stay seated to implement the rule.

Talking about emergency exit. I rescheduled my flight yesterday to take an earlier flight. As I did it less than three hours before new flight departure I had to buy a new full fare ticket.. so be it. 
When checking in I asked if they could give me an emergency exit as I had paid for that on the other booking. Reply was “yes” but you have to pay again..... In the plane BOTH EMERGENCY EXIT ROWS ON BOTH SIDES of the aisle were fully empty. How commercial is that?

I have tried to contact the flightcompany three times, but not a single answer from them. I know they are probably really busy these times, but after almost a month I don´t have that much patience anymore. As you see I have wrote them my complaint about the flight we had (below this message and you can also see it in the printscreen I have made of my mails to them). I don't think I ask a lot of them, thinking of the horrible time we had in Japan. Their agents don't help you with anything!

Dear Sir/Madam,

On Friday 20th of March, my girlfriend an I booked a flight from Da Nang Airport to Haneda (Tokyo) with your flightcompany (flight VJ936). From your agents at the airport we heard that we could board the flight without any problem, so we booked the flight. We are from the Netherlands and they knew that, but still they said that it wasn't a problem.

Once we landed in Haneda around 01:00am, the immigration of Japan rejected us to get into Japan. We couldn't get in, because we have an European passport. To be honest, I found your agents not really helpful at that time. They just said to us ""you have to book a flight as soon as possible, otherwise you can't get out of Japan!"". After that they just left us. We were locked up by the immigration into a room after that and had to stay there till 10:00pm, which was almost a whole day. It was really unpleasant, if you can imagine it. Also the way most of them treated us, felt like we were actually criminals.

The thing that dissapointed us the most, was with the check-in of our luggage. Normally we could just check in our checked baggage, but this time we also had to put that in the scan. They took the Swiss knive of my girlfriend which her grandmother gave her and now it's gone. It might be not worth really a lot, but it had really a lot of emotional value for her. If we weren't stuck there, this would never happen.

From what I know, is that we were the only European people who boarded the flight from Da Nang to Haneda. Now we have paid for a flight with only misery and we haven't even reached our goal to enter Japan at all. So what I like to ask you is a refund for the flight we paid from Da Nang Airport to Haneda (Tokyo). We're not asking for additional costs that we made, but only the flight. Our names and passport numers are:

Flight VJ936

Passenger 1: Ka-Kim Lam
Passport number: ...

Passenger 2: ...
Passport number: ...

I think it is really dissapointing that the agents in Vietnam boarded us on the plane, while we couldn't get into Japan. I really hope you can do something about this to improve the situation.

Kind regards,

Ka-Kim Lam & ...",Date of travel: March 2020,

One has to either pay additional amount for the excess weight in one single baggege or have to throw away the stuff. Basically they are looking ways to somehow get additional money by using any means. Same goes with water on aircraft. USD 2.5 for 350ml water bottle and if you pay USD3, they will give you 10k VND as change and when you try to buy second water bottle they refuse to accept the USD2 and same 10k VND note they have given in change as they say it is not USD0.5.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,How bad can an airline experience be,"Tried for hours to make reservation online. Never could get it to reserve though it took my credit card information snd charged my card three times. 
Finally ask help if hotel tour desk. The girl there claimed to have made reservation and had electronic receipt with booking number. She forwarded the receipt to me. I paid her cash for the two tickets.

Get to airport very early thank goodness. I take my paper with booking data to baggage check area. Never heard if me. Directed to another desk which was apparently ticket sales desk. After lot of computer searching by the agent; they have no reservation. After lot of Vietnamese speaking by my companion, apparently Vietjet claims the reservation was cancelled. Three charges to credit card and booking number plus call to hotel person who made the reservation had no meaning. Only solution was to but two new tickets. Ok bought two new tickets. Hotel agreed to deposit the amount paid in my companion’s bank in Saigon. Don’t have any idea what would have been done if I did not have access to this account.
This all took a half an hour. Back to baggage line; now a long line. At counter finally, there was a charge of 360,000 dong. Can’t pay there; back to desk where bought ticket. Paid the baggage fee and got slip of paper as a receipt. Back to baggage counter. Fortunately, my companion was familiar with such bureaucratic activity and firmly held her place at the counter. Had I been alone, I would have had to go to the back of a long line. 
Paid the fee and off to gate. No thanks to Vietjet, the security check line was brief. Of course, would have been ok even with these delays as the flight was late leaving. Actual flight there was uneventful. 
After several weeks and some effort, the charges on my credit card disappeared.
Left the other money in my companion’s bank account as a gift for her help in making this venture possible. 
The big issue is that the flight was all but full and we were fortunate that there were still two seats available for purchase that close to departure. 
Second issue is the time spent trying to make online reservation and resulting credit card charges. Never feared I would loose the money but was afraid that Citi fraud department would freeze the card due to three simultaneous charges for same amount. Would have been difficult to get s new card the way I was traveling.
Third issue was all the anxiety and time spent trying to resolve the lack of reservation in spite of booking number. 
Tried once more to use Vietjet due to their schedule but after only five minutes with hotel trying to help we gave up and hotel advice was to never fly Vietjet. Went to JetStar Airlines for excellent online website and several great flights. JetStar agents and procedures at the airport are very efficient and good.
In the past I have used Vietnam Airlines which was also good but much more expensive than JetStar snd Vietjet. 
Bottom line, with JeStar serving most of the same market, avoid Vietjet like a bad disease unless you have no bag to deal with and walkup to counter and buy a ticket at departure time.",Date of travel: February 2020,

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Love VietJet.com !,"We took two VietJet flights to and from Bangkok and Dalat / Danang during our recent Vietnam trip.

The booking process is very straightforward and all prices are transparently displayed. We were even allowed to change our return flight from Vietnam for a reasonable fee !

All flights were on time and actually arrived back in BKK ahead of schedule !

There was a flight schedule change for our return journey, but were e-mailed of change two days beforehand, so reasonable notice.

ALL baggage (including hand baggage) is carefully weighed at check in. If over weight limits better to buy additional  baggage allowance before check in.

Have flown with VietJet several times over the past few years and never had any problems flying with them.

Look forward to our next VietJet flight !",,"[{'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}]"

The food provided was typical airline food (what else !). Booked 2 flights with them for domestic flights (via their own webpage) and very reasonably priced. Now the problem- both flights were changed without them informing me, however, I regularly check my flights so I was aware of the changes.(One day before departure) One of the flights was actually cancelled on their webpage, but reinstated the next day.  I took hand luggage and one checked in suitcase and made sure both were within the airlines allowances, as pre previous reviews you will be charged  if going over the allowance. Would I book with them again, Unlikely, I would book with Vietnam airways slightly dearer but in my opinion more reliable.

No reason given except some ground work problem. I expect they forgot the bus to come and ferry us to the terminal. The next plane that landed before ours, we could see the passengers in the same position, they would not move the exit steps up for so long. So then by the time we actually got out of the airport was much later than it should be. Complete incompetence!  I had booked a transport bus into the city with my ticket. Crammed onto the bus, I reckon it would not have waited for me. I was nearly the last one off the bus and it was 1.5 hours trip and well into rush hour traffic. The bus staff just said they go no further at one point and dumped me on the side of a busy road. Lucky I had GPS map, I was 2kms from my Guest house, had to get a Grab but it took ages at that time of day and crazy dangerous ride. 
Coming back, I had booked a bus to the airport. The pick up points were several KMs from my stay and would have cost more than the #86 public bus to the airport to get to.(look up this bus, far better and nicer journey)  The flight back, delayed, should have landed 15.25 but got to HCMC after 5pm.

I politely informed her that she would have to give them to these guys, which of course she didn't like to much as due to the tiredness, delay, confusion and then helping said couple fill out their arrival cards I actually made a small error on mine. 

I then requested another one from Tracy who rudely informed me that they all gone. To which I replied ''you have many'' so she said I will look and if so bring you one.
I KNEW she wouldn't so when she was at the back I headed to the front of the plane and asked another staff for the card as I had been asleep to which she proceeded to pull out 100's and gave with no issue. Yeah you want to f me up you will have to work a little harder than that. And these people are meant to be assisting!

We had a three hour layover in ho chi Minh and believed this would be long enough in case of delays for a transfer. Dead wrong. The flight was heavily delayed and then we were forced to remain on the airplane on arrival for more than 30 minutes ruining our last chance to run to our flight.

Other problems were clear throughout the experience.

1 - buying checked luggage online was nearly impossible forcing it to be done at the airport

2 - buying checked luggage at the airport required being there more than three hours before the flights scheduled departure so you have to be there close to four hours before your flight to be safe.

3 - even after purchasing our 2 checked luggage (at a separate desk) the check in agent then told us we only had bought one even though we paid the price of 2 and had made it clear to all the people involved who had confirmed we had bought two. He then told us we could go back and talk to the desk and buy another bag for 330k or just slip him a 200k and he'd put it through. AKA bribe him to do what we'd already paid for. 

The only good thing I can say is that the airplane was comfortable and the staff
onboard nice but everything else about this experience was a Trainwreck don't use this airline.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for a budget Airlines,"Had a last minute plan for a holiday getaway to bangkok. I booked the flight about 7 days before travelling. The departure from Hanoi was on time and arrival was slightly earlier than expected. Departure from Bangkok was also spot on. Check-in was relatively easy and fast (although i would prefer some smiles and greetings. Felt like i was doing a machine check in)  

In flight was a bit of a let down. Do pre-book your meals if you think you need a bite because if you don't, they would have no food to serve you except for instant noodles. That is the only thing that they have in-stock (similar experiences both ways). So if you are travelling with kids, its highly recommended that you pre-book or at leave have some snacks in your bag. 

You dont feel the warmth the minute you set food in the plane as the steward/dess do not smile. Unlike other budget airlines.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst Flight,"Flew round trip from Tokyo to Hanoi. Got the two worst seats on the flight (near the exit). I’m 185 cm tall, so my legs are a bit long. Legroom was the least I’ve ever had on a flight, knees were permanently pressed against the seat in front of me. Narrow seats (though I’m thin). Every person traversing the aisles bumped into me as a result. Seat reclined 10 degrees at most. No room in overhead compartments for my carryon (backpack) on the way to Hanoi (exit seat), or on the way back (just no room in the cabin). No food OR WATER was provided on the 6.5 hour and subsequent 4.5 hour flight. You have to pay for water. Air was VERY dry, to the point where my friend’s and my lips cracked and our throats were dried out. Return flight was delayed an hour and a half due to “operational issues.” Seems the whole flight ended up waiting for one person who was flying SkyBOSS class, who boarded the plane 20 minutes late. Restroom had NO hand soap and the trash can was full just after takeoff. Did not receive customs declarations forms before landing. Intercom from the captain on both flights was excessively loud. Budget airline, so I didn’t expect any in-flight entertainment, which is good because there was none. Cabin attendants could often be found on their smartphones, but I realized that that was common in Vietnam, so I am not considering that in this review. Will avoid at all costs in the future, and I recommend you do the same. Could be a viable option if you bring your own water and food, don’t mind delays, and are relatively short and have a very narrow build (I’m male with a 34-inch waist, and was still a tight fit).",Date of travel: January 2020,

Mind you, the weight of your baggage should ONLY include your luggage thats all! No phone, iPad, purse, jacket, NOTHING. JUST. YOUR.

It, sadly, didn't occur to me to check the reviews of this airline prior to booking. I have flown domestically in many countries; however I could not conceive of a more disorganised shambles of an airline prior to arriving at Da Nang airport. No Vietjet planes arrive, or leave on time: this appears to be standard airline practice. Some are delayed by an hour, some seem to be delayed by 4 to 5 hours. I can divine no logic to the delays beyond disorganisation. Flight times pushed back every hour or so. No apology. 0 information, despite requests at information desk. The airline is not able to fulfill the service for the which it charges. In Europe or the US, it would be shut down: the flight delay compensation charges would see to that.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst experience in my life so far!,"Firstly their website is very poor, not in english and you can’t checkin online, nor pay for your luggage. I used skyscanner to buy my ticket but because I couldn’t manage my booking on Vietjet website,  at checkin I had to pay 400,000 idr which I find it a lot for Asia. They say you can pay online less than this, but it didn’t work.
Anyway, I wished that would have been my only complain, but I had to go through an almost hell of situation because their staff isn’t properly trained. I flu from Bali to HCMC and you normally need a letter to get your visa in Vietnam. Unfortunately I only had an application form which I thought it is what I need to enter Vietnam. They asked me for the letter at checkin and I showed them that application form. They seemed a bit confused, however they allowed me to embark. Once I got in HCMC, the immigration asked me for that letter, I showed the application form, but they insisted with that letter and refused what I had. Matter got worst because once reached Vietnamese airport, you can’t even apply for an emergency letter. They do not allow any agency to issue any letter once you get to the airport. But if Vietjet wouldn’t have allowed me to embark I would have still had the opportunity to buy it, even if I had to pay an emergency fee. Therefore, because I got to Vietnam without that letter I had to spend the night in the airport and be treated like a criminal and be deported back to Bali the second day. They said I should apply for the letter in Bali and come back to Vietnam. I was fine, however the situation got even worst when I got to Bali. Bacause they deported me to Bali, the immigration here refused my entry and even wanted to send me back home! After lots of tears, explanations that I am just an innocent traveller and if Vietjet wouldn’t have allowed me to embark to Vietnam I wasn’t in this situation, I managed to convince them to go back to Vietnam. They also checked with the Vietnamese immigration and after their approval they allowed me to buy a ticket back to HCMC. However, I had to spend another night in Denpasar’s airport because immigration still didn’t want to grant me the entry. Now I am on my way to HCMC and hopefully this nightmare will end up. But the final idea of my review is that if their staff would have been properly trained and not allow me to embark as they do with other people who don’t have that visa letter, I wouldn’t have gone through this nightmare. Therefore avoid flying with them if you can! their staff doesn’t seem too helpful either in solving problems.",Date of travel: January 2020,

They also stopped and checked a bearded man who might have been Indian, to double check if he was the vip when it is stated on his ticket. The staff did not believe him. 

Just bad service. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS AIRLINE. We are encouraging this horrible behaviour and racism. They also only serve Vietnamese people nicely. As I saw from queueing at the airport.

The weighed your carry-on at check-in to make sure you did not go overweight. At the gate, just before boarding, a girl from VietJet went around re-weighing the carry on luggage. I have never seen that before. I put my rather heavy jacket into my bag and bought something at the airport, so now my luggage was about 8.4 kg, and she said I had to pay 985,000 Dong (about 40USD). I took out the gift and my jacket and came down to 7.1 kg. During the flight, I asked for the Thai Arrival Card. The flight attendant said they did not have the card for this flight. This meant all the passengers who were not Thai citizens on board had to take the extra time completing the card and losing valuable time.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent Flight with Vietjet,"Flew with Vietjet on its newly introduced Singapore to Da Nang route. Departing from Singapore was smooth as always, with no queues at Security, Immigration and Check-In. The inbound flight arrived roughly on schedule, as it was the first flight of the day and thus we were able to depart within 20 minutes of schedule. The seat was thin and seat pitch was about the same as any other low-cost carrier. I pre-ordered the Shrimp Glass Noodles online for the price of SGD7.10 as it was around 20% cheaper than buying on-board. It tasted good but they should improve the portions of the meals. The flight attendants were friendly and warm when serving our meals. One thing worth mentioning is that Vietjet takes safety VERY seriously unlike some of the other low-cost carriers. The crew will walk up and down the aisle, multiple times, to ensure that your window shades are open, phones are switched off etc. Overall it was a pleasant flight with them.

On the return journey from Da Nang to Singapore however, the ground experience was not as pleasant and was borderline stressful. As Vietjet only had 4 check in desks for two international flights, the queues to the check-in counters were long. We waited for 40 minutes in the queue before being able to check-in. After check-in, we waited in another long queue before being able to pass immigration. In the airside area of the terminal there were only a few overpriced shops and restaurants which quote their prices in USD. The flight itself was delayed by 1 hour, as the previous arrival from Hanoi was late and Vietjet did not include sufficient turnaround time. Thankfully there were no further delays and the flight departed one hour late. The crew were once again friendly and warm when serving meals. Before arrival, the crew also walked down the aisle, clearing trash.

All in all, flying Vietjet is pleasant and safe. It is a good choice if you are a Leisure Traveller and don't mind arriving at your destination slightly late. If you are a business traveller where time is a priority, or if you are connecting to another flight, please look somewhere else.",Date of travel: December 2019,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

2.0 of 5 bubbles,The Practice Airline,"Queuing for check in took about an hour and it was like the check-in staff were all on their first  day. As we went through security the guy in front of me said that on the last flight with Vietjet the pilot looked about 15, and referred to it as a practice airline (brilliant). He also said the planes are held together with duct tape, proceeding to show me a picture of a seat being held together with actual duct tape. Obviously this was not my experience with the airline, but gave me a good idea of what to expect.

When I boarded the airplane the condition of the plane looked ok, with the exception of the strange old hotel carpet one the floor. For a relatively new airline there is a sense of everything looking a bit tired. Additionally the staff were miserable. I'm not surprised they were so unhappy considering we sat on the plane with 'Happy New Year by ABBA' on repeat for about 45 mins whilst our flight was more and more delayed. Food menu was actually ok for an airline. 

All in all, not a bad experience, but not a great one either. I wouldn't recommend this airline, and I'd say that if you can stretch your budget then go for one with a better rating.",Date of travel: December 2019,

They forced me to pay full 20Kg baggage amount which was 35 USD. That was my first experience with any International airline. And you may get surprise that at time of my travel Bali to Ho Chi Minh City just before 1 week, Vietjet staff of Bali allowed me same baggage and same hand bag.

First read the heartache of customers on trustpilot and on tripadvisor (here) before you consider booking with them. It's not worth it. 

Most people say ""I wish I'd listened to other reviews first"" and ""the same thing happened to me"". It will happen to you too. It's systematic and everyday policy for vietjetair.

Our experience in just one trip resulted in:

1) 4 full ticket charges for 1 ticket needed (due to bug in their system which as far as i know is still there - see multiple people on trustpilot who have lost money). Still they refuse to return our funds instead trying to push the problem on to us and our bank.

2) scam extra charges on baggage - not applied on checkin but they wait to do this at the terminal gate where they hold you to ransom - this is policy, not accidental they do it this way, again see others reviews and be warned. you don't get laptop as seperate weight btw as with most airlines, they will weigh every single thing on you and add it up to 7kg.

3) customer service awful, slow if you get any response at all. they will get back to you in ""3 to 5 days"" but they won't. pulling teeth to get responses. if you can finally get a dialogue they won't return your money, fix their extra transactions, or admit faults in their buggy system

4) both flights delayed by more then an hour. this is normal for vietjetair. expect to arrive late wherever you go.

Still waiting for urgent refund!!!!","I had flights booked for yesterday the 24th December 2 flights to Danang fia Ho Chi Mim. I turned up with lots of time to check-In. The check-in process the computer denied my entry as my passport has only 5 months left on it. I waited for a long time saying this is not a problem as I’m not going as a tourist and got no answer. Eventually I found government webpage proving that I could check in with UK passport with only 30 days remaining if I’m going for a work permit. At this point the manager came over and agreed, adding that only if you have proof of employment, which I had and showed straight away.!. after all this time had passed they checked and told Me by the time it is confirmed I will miss now check in!!

Already angry as not my fault I asked what I can do now to get to Danang. I was given a total inclusive fee to pay the next day of 2670bhat And both flight times would be the same. I arrived at desk ‪this morning at 11:15am‬ for ‪a 2:10pm‬ flight. One or two of the staff said they remembered me from yesterday and immediately started to process me. I waited untill ‪around 12:40pm‬ and they called me to collect tickets. I payed the late fee in cash (even though I was never late originally) and she gave me the ticket. In less than 1 minute I noticed that it was invorrect and invalid for my request! they had forgotten about my final destination, so I returned immediately to the same counter. I was told to phone the call centre and waited 34:12 minutes on hold, after all this the callcentre staff said they could not understand the situation. My problem is I need confirmation of my second flight (final destination) for the booking, To get through ho chi min airport. I cannot get tourist visa obviously , And my work visa is waiting for me ‘VIP Pickup’ in Danang. VietJet had forgotten the final destination (and second flight Had now completely cancelled),  and they then sold me that incorrect late fee on an unusable flight.

I should be thanked for saving VietJet money as After inevitably I was Denied entry to Vietnam under those conditions, VietJet would of had to fly me back to Phuket immediately at your expense. Luckily for you I noticed your error immediately! At the desk They could not even hand me back my money that I had given them IN CASH just minutes before, even though it’s VietJets mistake!

I have now paid for 8 seperate flight tickets with you over the past 2 days, been on time for every single one of them and yet due to your errors, me and my partner are still sat in Phuket airport right now.! On top of this I’ve had to pay huge last-minute hotel fees as it’s Christmas!!, 5 airport transfers Now!! as well as missing valuable work day!’ and cannot see my family on Christmas Day who were meeting me there!! On top I still now have to book a flight to get to Vietnam, but this time I’ll find an airline that actually provide that service. 

 I need a full refund and compensation for All costs / my expenses / added stress and time lost, which must be paid back to me immediately... and Immediately,  I cannot stress this enough! I cannot accept waiting 1 or two days, I am sat at your desk in Phuket airport now I cannot now leave. vietjet has cost me absolutely all my Thai baht savings over The past two days and I now have only 120bhat left on me In this country. I am awaiting your reply, I’m aware you have also been given my phone number, contact me either way.. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 

I’m sorry to say this but, without doubt, and  undeniably, this is by far the worst experience I have ever gone through, or even could ever even imagine going through, with a company. This needs to be sorted out Right Now VietJet.

However, this airline took the cake. This is my first time flying with Vietjet, and it was my fault that I did not include my middle name when I booked the flight (the middle name is in my passport), because middle name doesn’t really matter where I live. 

Anyway, the security has already told me to use my middle name next time I want to book a flight. However, once I started boarding, the staff of Vietjet at the gate stopped me again, she then proceed to ask her superior if I’m allowed on board. I was confused because I already went through security and had shown my passport and boarding pass, so I thought this was fine already. She then started to ask if my flight was a round trip and I said yes, though she kept on changing the wording which confused me because there were some words in Vietnamese that I did not understand (they spoke to me in Viet since I’m fluent). 

After all that, they decided I’m allowed on board, but before I go, the staff said something about paying attention, to which I didn’t get it right away as to pay attention to what, so I asked her what is she talking about? This is when her superior (red uniform, short hair, always look annoyed) snapped and snatched my passport and boarding pass from the staff’s hand, pointed the pass to my face while began to raise her voice and almost yelling at me “Your name! Don’t you see that you’re missing the middle name?!” At this point I was fuming, the whole interaction was uncomfortable enough, since everyone there looks like they hate their job scanning tickets, they looked annoyed having to deal with me, I didn’t care nor did I expected them to have a smile on their faces, but to raise their voice at me because of a middle name, in which issue they had already decided to let go?

So story starts from checking in at the airport which was totally fine. The staff weight my hand luggage and it was within the limit (7kg). 

So after I checked in and went through the security check, as you can imagine, I went shopping at the duty free, very normal. 

And the tricking part came when I queued to get on board at the gate as some staff were there to weigh our luggages again! And even the stuff I bought from duty free!!! This absolutely doesn’t makes sense at all! I’ve travelled with so many cheap airlines and have never ever experienced something like this. 

Of course, I’m not the only one who were being scammed. There was a guy who got a big coat with him holding and they weight that as well. And when he just left the coat there and or just to put on the coat, the staff said to him ‘Are you throwing something away?’ ‘Don’t put on your coat/hide something in your coat!’ What the hell? Seriously I don’t get it? What’s wrong with these staff? Fyi, at the end, there was around 10+ of passengers who were being scammed like this on this flight. 

If that’s your policy then you should put it in black and white and tell us in advance when we check in. Not scamming and tricking customers like this!

Then when going through security, I was told that I was an allowed to bring my two EpiPen‘s onto the flight. The staff wasn’t aware of what they were actually for, thinking that they were medical necessities I would need on the plane, as opposed to an emergency if I had an allergic reactions (highly allergic to oranges). I was told it was company policy to only allow one EpiPen on the plane at a time. I never saw this in any of the warnings when purchasing my ticket and had traveled on 5 different flights with both epiPens in my carry on. I ended up having to throw away one of my EpiPen’s, which are quite expensive, because my bag that I had to pay for was already checked and on its way to the plane. I also wasn’t allowed to sit in the seat I paid extra for because I had a “medical condition” that wouldn’t allow me to assist in an emergency situation. I also wasn’t given a refund. I was required to sign a waiver in order to bring my EpiPen on board. The flight ended up costing me more than any other budget airline would have in terms of flight, extra for the seat, checked bags and the loss of my EpiPen. I will NEVER travel on this airline again.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Stolen items in my checked luggage,"I'll try to make it short. 

VietJet flights are very cheap but they do not include a checked luggage, so I payed for an extra 20kg bag. 

I made two mistakes:
1- I did not use a lock on my luggage.
2- After I arrived, I did not opened and check it WHILE I WAS STILL AT THE ARRIVAL AIRPORT (does anyone ever do that?).

When I finally opened it at the hotel, I directly noticed some items missing (chocolate and earphones). I directly went back to the airport to fill a report at the ""lost and found"" counter. The same day they called me to ask me to send pictures of my luggage, so they could check their cameras. 

After one week I hadn't received any update, I wrote them another email, not answered. 

After 9 days I went back to the airport, and after some discussion with the lost & found employees, they finally called the VietJet manager, ""responsible"" for lost & found items. 

After reciting a perfectly learnt apology from VietJet, he told me they checked the cameras and didn't find the employee who stole something inside my luggage, and as I reported the stolen items AFTER I left the airport, VietJet was no longer responsible for it. Therefore, there would be no compensation. 

My flight cost me around 800.000 VND, and the stolen items were about the same price. I don't call that a cheap flight anymore. 

What I particularly disliked was the patronizing and sarcastic behavior from the VietJet manager. He implied pretty clearly that I was lying and kept asking me ""where are your proofs?""

We booked flight from Singapore day before we had to leave as we needed to be in Nha Trang within 24 hours to catch a ship. This was shortest flying time but had one stop in Ho Chi Minh. When we got to airport to check in the staff alone was unreal. No one barely spoke English and they told
Us flight was delayed over 3 hours. That would mean we would miss connecting flight to Nha Trang so we said we couldn’t do it and had purchased the travel insurance and wanted refund. They assured us that if we didn’t get on that flight we would get on a later connecting flight at 11pm so we continued on. This doesn’t account to although we paid bag fee when we booked we were only allowed 15 kilos period and every addional kilo was 20/kilo. It ended
Up being $500 🙄 plus the flight cost, insurance and other bag fee. This one way was well over $1000. Had we known the truth we would have never flown. Plus they only allowed us to pay the baggage fees in cash which was super shady and we had to empty our wallets and go to ATM with $10 fees to pay for it… But we did so because we needed to get there and here’s the kicker ....So we went on plane knowing we would get to Nha Trang once we got to Ho Chi Minh. When we deplaned in Ho Chi Minh we went through customs and out of international departures and over to via jet local departures to catch or 11 PM flight to Nha Trang. To our Shock and horror there was no 11pm flight! They lied to us and took out money and charged us both luggage fees for each flight and could never get us there. We couldn’t believe  it. When confronted they said sorry we can’t help you. This airline needs to be shut down. They didn’t offer us refund. And robbed us our cash for a flight they never had for us.

Well I paid dearly in time, effort— wasted precious hours of my visit. The app failed, claiming that it could not recognize my first credit card. Thinking that there was something wrong w my card, I entered a second credit card with the same negative results. By now, a 5 minute transaction has turned into 30 or more minutes— bottom line, no tickets nor confirmation numbers given.
Then I was notified by two of my banks that money was charged to both from VietJet. Adding to the confusion was that I never received a confirmation email and the number.
By now I was frustrated enough and called the support number. The VietJet Air personnel on the customer support said they needed a confirmation number in order to help, to which I explained that I never got one. The circus continues even as they were able to locate our names.
The next day thinking that a visit to a local VietJet Air would straighten out the mess, I took off with a mission to resolve the problem once and for all. Big mistake. The trip ended in another failure and no tickets still.

Sure, the web price of tickets seems very cheap, but after you click through all the options, it really isn't that cheap at all.

Here are the list of the things that got me not wanting to book with them anymore.
1. Booked flights through their website, which btw, isn't the most user friendly. I had mad a mistake with the names in the booking (totally my fault), so I had to call them to get it corrected.  It took my 2-3 days of me trying to call them to finally have someone pick up the phone!  and when they did, I had to wait over an hour just so they can find someone who spoke English.  In the end, they did managed to make the corrections.

2. When I did book the flights ( I flew with them twice), both times I paid to get seat selection (for less than $2USD per seat, I figured why not!.  Only to find out when I checked in, they never had my seat selection requests! I had to show them the email where I actually booked and paid for it!  Both times, I found out that they gave the seats to someone else already!  Luckily, they managed to sit us either a row behind or a row in front. Not cool.

3. Going in, I knew they had some crazy small weight limit for carry-on, but it wasn't until I started to pack light that I realize the weight is only good if you were going for a day trip.  It definitely is not someone who plans to travel all of Vietnam for more than 3 days even.  (I had a light Heys carry on, which would be suffice on most other airlines, just not this one!... the carry-on luggage itself takes up half the weight of their allowance!

There are probably a few I've missed. They refused a refund and told me I'd need to apply on-line. Then they told me I could not carry my second bag on board and charged me 849 Baht, almost $30 USD, which is close to 50% of the ticket price. This exact same bag has flown with me on all of the above mentioned airlines, plus another 50+ airlines over the past 10 years. I bought this bag in 2005 and have NEVER had to check it until this flight. And I'm including the two most difficult airlines for luggage i.e. RyanAir and EasyJet.
 They did seat me in a preferred seat at the front, so maybe that equalled the exit row surcharge.
 Just in case it seems that I'm exaggerating, I do fly a lot. Generally over 100K per year. I have lifetime gold status with United and lifetime Platinum status with American. Both require over 1 million miles.

Not many people flying first  class but economy is always full to max. The crew mostly speaks Korean and Vietnamese but one crew member did speak English, not a problem for me because I speak near fluent Korean but if English is your only language it may be a problem. Service was attentive crew was very kind to everyone, flight was smooth and uneventful and the landing was butter smooth, I have flown most of Asia's top carriers and this was the lightest and smoothest landing ever.

Flights are between £20-40 usually taking about 1-2 hours. However.. I would highly recommend avoiding VietJet at all costs. The 3 short flights we took were all delayed including one where we had to disembark the plane (due to a technical issue) after being delayed by an hour. Vietjet also change the time of the flight 24 hours before the plane is supposed to leave, so if you do find yourself on one of these planes, definitely check your emails the day before. It’s understandable that their a budget airline and delays do happen but it might be worth paying an extra £20 with another airline to avoid delays...or even take the bus or train. The only positive I can take from these experiences with Vietjet is that it got us to our destination in one piece.

However this evening when I went to check in at the counter in HCMC I was told my carry on was over the 7kg allowance and was 9kg. I was told by the lady I could pay an extra 300k per kilo. I then started to move stuff around in front of her while at the desk when she told me that I could actually check it on for only 300k. I decided to do that and when I did she told me to remove my phone she had seen amongst my luggage and bring it with me on the plane. I asked her why and at the time it didn’t occur to me that she thought it could be stolen. While on the flight I realised that my money (about 6mill VND or €240) was in an envelope in that bag as I thought I would have it with me on the plane when I packed. When I collected my bag in Hanoi, it was the first thing I checked and unfortunately I wasn’t shocked to see my envelope crumpled up at the top of my bag empty with all the money taken and all of my clothes and belongings had been rooted through. I can’t describe the disappointment, upset and sheer anger I felt at the realization that I or clearly the Vietjet employees at the counter were not even able to trust their co workers in security or loading the bags on to the plane to do so without stealing their own customers belongings. 
I told airport security in Hanoi who told me that it wasn’t Vietjet’s responsibility of what happens to valuable belongings while in their care. 
I am entirely saddened by the whole situation and how it was dealt with. I will of course never fly with Vietjet again. I feel completely violated and cannot believe that having paid for a flight and presumably then having yourself and your belongings looked after they would then be stolen by employees of the company or airport.
I think the company’s policy of not claiming responsibility over valuables is an absolute cop out and clearly breeds a culture within the company where it is ok to steal from customers. 
It’s an incredibly uncomfortable feeling knowing the level of unprofessionalism of Vietjet or airport staff and furthermore the lack of action to prevent it or to protect customers against it. 
Having spent over a year living in Vietnam it has been my single worst experience to date and sadly has left a bad taste in my mouth about it.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,THIEVING SCUM!,"Definately the worst airline experience! Travelled with hand baggage only which when weighed at check in was accepted for carry on and an 'approved' tag applied. At the gate I was picked out to have my bag weighed They combine a computer case with the carry on bag and in total it came to under 9kg using their no doubt fixed scales. The thieves then said I had to check it in and pay 950,000 VND around USD40. An evil and callous officer, though not sure he directly worked for the airline as not in uniform or wearing a staff badge, said I had to pay in cash only. I am 100% convinced that money is shared between others involved in the scam practice. Obviously what they do is to have the check in staff approve carry on luggage and then the gate refuse to take on board as they can charge, accoring to the small print, a much higher penalty.
What was most interesting was the racism and social profiling. They only checked westerners or those with quality luggage. The locals were let on with no checks and two bags! This just paints a very bad picture of the Vietnamese people who just want to cheat and extort foreigners.
I use the same bag combination when travelling light and have never had a problem with other LCC's such as Scoot, Jetstar, Air Asia etc
Furthermore their website booking is lousy and very complex, most probably purposefully, and what starts as showing a S$150 ticket soon becomes S$250 with all the hidden add ons.
The aircraft was also absolutely filthy inside.

I understand keeping some weight down, but they really should let people buy stuff in the airport after they get through security. They could get away with charging more if they did, the next comparable flight was $500 more expensive.

So the flight wasn't full. There were two people who thought they had an exit seat but really ended up with an uncomfortable seat near the exit with no legroom that didn't lean back - I almost picked those seats because I didn't know any better, thank goodness I was in the infinite legroom exit seat which cost the same $11 to pick. And they couldn't switch to the better empty exit row seats because...

The indignities they impose don't stop there - the flight attendant doing the safety presentation dumped a bunch of stuff on the guy in the no-legroom exit row to do the safety presentation because using the tray that wasn't in anyone's lap was not what they normally do. They also yell at people to turn off their phones before takeoff even when they are in airplane mode. Then on a red-eye they would wake people up at random times for no good reason. I really would have wanted that extra hour+ of sleep over the immigration forms.

The flight was an hour late due to late staff, but that was baked into the trip. And the check in was a little unpredictably bad- the line I was in switched from ""all flights"" to ""Not my flight"" after I've been in it for a while. So I had to go to another one...

What a racket! Carry on had a 7kg Limit and when we got on the 
Plane we realized that the bags of the locals were certainly not 7kg. When we got to baggage claim we saw that hardly any bags were there. I have requested a refund of the difference, and if this has happened to you, I encourage you to do the same. Since the email is nonexistent on the website, here it is: vz.support@vietjetair.com.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,WARNING,WARNING!!! DONT FLY WITH THIS COMPANY!! Please read all of this. I recently traveled with vietjet and the absolute worst experience ever. And I’ve flown Canada Air. It started when my travel was affected by a typhoon on a Saturday. I called on a weekend to try and get assistance but regular employees were not helpful and a little rude. I asked to speak to a manager and they said no. If I want to speak to a manager I have to call back on Monday or send an email and someone will get back to me in 3 to 5 days. If you have an emergency on a weekend you will not get any help. On my return flight once we arrived the male attendant never got out of his seat or said anything to any of the passengers. He just sat in his seat looking at pictures of girls on his phone. Then I got my luggage. And to my surprise I noticed some damage to a wheel. I brought this up to an employee at the airport and I was told there’s nothing that can be done for me because the damage was caused from regular use. And if I want give feedback send an email. So they won’t help me because apparently a 2 year old suitcase is old and can break easily. Upon arriving home I noticed much more damage than I originally saw. My suitcase not only had damage to a wheel but also it was cracked in 3 separate spots. When I opened the suitcase a bottle of sake I had was demolished. Completely shattered. The bottle was was in a padded box so it didn’t simply just fall over. The same leaked onto my watch and ruined my watch in the suitcase. I sent an email to simply inform them of how I was treated. I didn’t even ask for the $300 of damage that was caused. I was simply giving feedback. And I got a return email saying they can’t help me because I didn’t submit a complaint at the airport. I replied to this saying I tried but their employee wouldn’t assist me. They replied with a copy and paste of their policies and procedures for damaged luggage. It wasn’t until I told them I would write bad reviews about this experience did they finally apologize for their employer misleading with incorrect information and not assisting me properly. This is not how to treat someone who spends a lot of money and puts their trust in a company that they will get the person and their belongings to their destination safely and without damage. I’m absolutely disgusted that I had to threaten bad reviews to even get an acknowledgement that they messed up. They were more interested in telling me why they won’t pay for the damage then taking responsibility for what they did. Terrible terrible terrible company. I hope you read all of this and refuse to use this airline.,Date of travel: October 2019,
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oops! I did it again.,"I've had the best of times, I've had the worst of times.  Vietjet, you are impossible to understand.
Yesterday I was charged $420 for excess baggage.  Due to a  Vietjet mistake.

The details:  I made a booking on the website, and made a mental note that my passenger information asks for my Middle Name first, and my First/Given Name second.  Why is this important? Because the booking is stored as Surname, Middlename Firstname.  The ticket itself is correct.
So, unable to access the online booking, and the Bangkok call centre not answering, I decided to arrive early at the airport to check in my 20kg of baggage.
At check in they tell me I have 2 choices: pay THB8,400 (AUD$420) or leave the bag.
I tried everything.  Can I just buy another ticket ($150)? No, only one ticket per passenger.  Can I upgrade to Airboss for its extra baggage allowance? No. No change allowed. Why?  Too late.  Only 2 hours and 50 minutes until flight.  But we started talking 20 minutes ago!!  Then I had 3 hours!  Yes, but not now. No change now.
Ok, I'll pay, and go to the payment counter, where I explain that the online booking login is wrong and I couldn't access it, so I have this thb8,400 fee.  She says ""Go take your bag over there (pointing).  Just 100 fee.)"".  I thought this sounded really good and I'd met someone helpful. After going ""over there"" I see the oversize baggage counter and handed my bag (a bicycle bag). I wanted to pay the thb100 fee but they say no.  Wow, no fee!
I go back to the check-in counter and explain that it is all fixed. ""Oh no!! What you do?"" No no no!!"".  She rings people, gets my bag back and after I explain, she gets the fee-waiving woman.  She says she told me to go to the Storage Area, not the Oversize Area.  I was accused of dirty tricks in Thai language.  The ""fee-waiving woman"" said they have video tape and can check exactly what she said to me. I said ""Ok! Let's find out if you or me or both of us made mistakes"".  She chats with her check-in co-worker in Thai.  ""We must go to police station.  For this.  Very important"". I say ""Ok.  Where?"" and she becomes very angry and leaves, which confuses me somewhat.  The check-in woman says I must pay thb8,400 and go to the payment counter.  So, defeated by the stonewalling, I go pay my excess baggage fee at the payment counter, where I am helped by the two staff other than the ""We have videotape"" woman.  I casually ask one of them if there are cameras or videotape here.  Smiling and almost laughing, she says ""No sir"".  I say ""Really? No cameras?"" And she repeats to me that there are no cameras, smiling and almost laughing at my crazy suggestion.
On my way past, I thought I'd say farewell and ask the name of the  ""fee waiving not - and said she had videotape"" woman.  Just in case I want to lodge a complaint.  She looks at me.  Nothing.  I ask if she if deaf. No, her work mate says. Then she picks up a non-ringing phone and starts talking into it.  Oh my goodness.  A customer service vampire, this one.
He workmates rush to give me the email address for complaints, a feedback form.... and her name.  So helpful.  I can't help but wonder if they've seen this many times over?
So that's it.  A $150 fate that was turned into $670 because a Vietjet programmer confuses First and Middle names, and missing the three hour limit for a booking change because the helpful check-in woman and I wasted 20 minutes talking about how to solve the login problem.

The worst thing about this?  Other people are having similar experiences.  Does Vietjet care? Definitely not.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Safe yourself time, money and stress... by avoiding Vietjet","Air fare with Vietjet are very cheap. If you are on a budget go with it, but be aware thatcalmost all their flights are delayed from 1-2h delay is not a strange thing to them and is quite standard. My longest delay was 12h and not only once...

Fares are cheap but they find all the ways to get your money out of your pocket and you end up paying the same fare if you would book a premium flight. 

(E.g. do not advise you to pay additional add on luggage on your hand carry, so you will be surprised at the boarding counter where you need to pay triple the luggage price even if you are just 500g over the allowed 7kg.,  asking you to pay priority check in fee if your 15min before checkin to make it on time, but they know already that their flight will be delayed and there is absolute no rush to check in. 
Crews come 1h or so later than schedule flight time, airplanes are have not even arrived for scheduled flight time and so on and on. No reimbursement for any delays. Sometimes you are lucky if the give you free water for half a day waiting)

I am a very patient and understanding person. But even me after so many flights with Viet Jet have say it is the worst airline....
With that being said that i travel a lot! 

Safe yourself stress and time as you will end up paying premium fees anyways.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst airline in the world,"Checked in with plenty of time to spare. Massive lines at immigration and security (consider this also a bad review of tan son nhat airport - 3 hours before is not sufficient) meant that when we arrived at the gate we were turned away. Apparently the last bus to the plane had left. Plane itself still in plain sight, still time left before departure. We are told we can pay to get on the plane, or buy a new ticket. At this point there are about 22 people in the same situation protesting. Having unsuccessfully solicited a bribe, the two Vietjet staff tell us that since there are so many of us, they will make an exception, please follow them. Everyone does, with relief. 

We finally realise we are actually being taken the long way round back to security when our passports are taken. We are told that we can pay for new tickets or just sit there and hope our bags (on the 'missed' flight) get sent back eventually. Families with toddlers are basically in tears at this point. You have very little bargaining power when someone disappears with your passport in a country where you don't speak the language. We are given two options: pay to be rescheduled on a flight 7 hours later, or buy a new ticket for another time. No fee waivers or refunds - this is obviously not that sort of story.

I choose the first option and cough up the cash. My passport is returned to me. I go through the whole check in, immigration, security routine again - to find out that boarding for the second flight is of course, delayed by 2 hours (in 30 minute reveals for maximum discomfort). When we finally start boarding, I am told by the grinning Vietjet staff that I have to weigh my bag again on one of those little mechanical scales (6.5kg at check in, tagged, approved) - somehow it is now suddenly 7.8kg. Weird, but no problem right? It's just 0.8kg over the weight limit. While these magic scales continue to screw over multiple people around me, I am told pay to check my entire bag in, or the plane will leave without me. Cash preferred.

When we finally take off, we are almost 3 hours late. From the time of my arrival at the airport, it has been more than 12 hours and I'm still in the same place. I've paid twice my original ticket price in fees alone. I am given an arrival card to fill in. I ask to borrow her pen. She tells me they don't have a policy to lend out pens.

And of course when I ask... “why did they let us through in the first place if we actually aren’t allowed this?” Nobody knows and the only answer I get is “it’s not my job”. 

They wanted us to check in the extra hand luggage we had just paid for, which was all cameras and laptops (you can’t check these in anyways???). It seems like they have no knowledge of any protocols other than their little scam... so they say they’ll do us a “big favor” and let us carry our few extra kgs with us on the plane (so now I have to write a note on MY receipt... so to myself?.... giving a reason for why I need to have my laptop and camera with me.

Yes, like police doing spot checks! They will start weighing passengers' hand carry luggages with a big weighting scale which can be found at a fish monger's stall. They don't care what's inside and stack all our luggages on top of each other and count to the nearest precision. Then they will say the hand carries are overweighed and denine us from boarding before we pay them a fine of 950,000 dong. [This rate is for 1kg to 20kg, non negotiable] Worse still, the check-in counter staff that attended to us earlier was also there but when we raised the issue to her, there was no assistance at all. It was as if that was the first time seeing us. Cold shoulder, period. 

They do this catching and weighting to many customers. It was an utterly ugly sight with mothers being with held for baby trolleys and what not. Just when passengers are good to board, good to go, the airline will caught you by surprise. If they want to scrutinise passengers' luggages then do it at the check-in counter level. NOT at the boarding gate when no rectifications can be done except to contribute to their additional income with ""fines"". That's not very fine. Using safety as a reason at the very last minute is certainly not a very good excuse to passengers.

Think they should rename to ""hijack"" airline not VietJet. Very double standard and sneaky indeed. Should never convey something to passengers and then practice otherwise.

Oh and for both the departure and return flights were ""delayed due to late arrival of aircraft"" as announced by them onboard. Not sure if any of their planes ever arrive on time.

This is the worst airline with the slowest and ridiculous service ever. When the time my boyfriend and I travelling back from Vietnam to Hong Kong, each of us have our hand-carry luggages and have been weighted at the check-in counter. For that being said on its official website, if our luggages overweighted, we are supposed to be charged at the check-in counter. Given that our luggages’ weight didn’t over the limit, right after we passed  the custom, we bought more souvenirs and duty-free cosmetic as usual, which of course, added weight to the original luggage. 

Right at the moment we were at the boarding gate, the staff requested to weight our luggage again, which of course our luggages overweighted for extra 3kg, and they charged us to pay Vietnamese 950,000 (Around USD 46) dollars for that. This is very ridiculous and unprofessional since they should have said it earlier at the check-in counter that they are being so strict on this over weight luggage policy, that we wouldn’t have been buying extra souvenirs after we passed the custom. When we asked about the staff name and no. of that particular staff that requested us to pay the extra charge, there was another staff beside who said she doesn’t know about her name and reluctant to provide her name for me as well to have any other follow up actions, she also told me if I need to further discuss on that issue, I can stay behind and to take the next flight, which is so far the most ridiculous service that I have ever had as a frequent traveller. I wasn’t even to take a photo of that particular staff since they were threatening us if we don’t pay at that point we would have to pay for another tickets to take another flight. meanwhile before we actually board on the plane, we further requested the staff who took my suitcase (the blue one), to give us back so that we can hand-carry with us, and he wasn’t even let us to take it either, and there’s another female staff yelling at us for forcing us to board on the plane.

And the worst thing is, it plans to move business into Europe, which means more delayed, sad, people all over the world using this awful airline. We’ve totalled 4 flights with them and all have been delayed 30-1 hour (this current one being the total of 4 and half hours). Currently I have wasted 8 hours of my life with vietjet delays over 2 weeks of travelling Vietnam and Cambodia. 

What makes it worse is the total lack of communication. Gates change, flight times are changed without announcement and you are told to start boarding only to wait at the gate confused as to why no one hasn’t turned up yet at the desk to take your ticket. When our plane had a “technical error” we were told to leave the plane, then stay as it was being fixed in 10-15 minutes, and then an hour of radio silenced resulted in us being dumped in departures lounge with no information except the small electric board changed. All the locals seemed to know what to do which suggests this happens a lot. 

Also they play the same awful songs constantly, so if you are unlucky enough to be delayed on the plane (which we have been today for a total of 2 hours of our wait), they will only play mamma Mia - and I believe I can fly - over and over. 

Also whilst writing this review, the vietjet staff just announced a further 50 min delay but they also shut the doors and put the seat belt sign on. So we have no idea if we are flying or not.

Unfortunately a lot of the time VJ flights are the only ones that fit around my schedule so I have no choice but to go with them, and I even book with them with the faintest hope that “THIS time I won’t be delayed and VJ will come through!”...just to be disappointed.

My flight from HCMC to PQ a few days ago was delayed, I turn up to the airport and at the check in desk it’s a different time on display. They don’t even have the words ‘delayed’ up on the screen as if they’re trying to kid themselves and others into thinking that VJ don’t delay flights. Low and behold I turn up to the airport today for my return flight and my flight is displaying a delayed time again!!

I can always count of VJ to let me down! They should really change their company slogan as “Enjoy flying!” does not reflect the VJ experience at all. Maybe change it to “Enjoy being disappointed and arriving at your destination much later than expected”.

I feel sorry for their staff as I know it’s not their fault, and they’re ultimately the ones who have to deal with the disappointed customers. 

So yeah in a nutshell, VietJet are terrible.",Date of travel: October 2019,

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Simply Cheap!!,"Read quite reviews on Trip adviser and found lot of complaints. Surprisingly we were 2 families and did not face any problems. You are a business class traveller or like to travel in class AVOID this airline. If you are a leisure traveller who likes to travel cheap and take some difficulty in stride then you can GO for this airline. 
WE travelled from Hanoi to Da Nang and then Da Nang to Ho Chi Min city.
Benefits:
1. Cheapest tickets available in Vietnam for internal travel. Avg price is about 60 USD ( what I paid )
2. My flights were on time. No cancellations.
3. I am a pilot and travelled in lot of FSC and LCC airlines, Vietjet has decent seats for short flights for the money you pay.
4. Cost of check in baggage is very less better to buy in advance. I paid 16 usd for 30 kgs for domestic flights.  
5. Crew was polite. 

Hassles and Tips ( Problems for some)
1. Go well in advance for your check in. Since its cheap lot of people travel on it and one hour is not enough. Expect huge queues for check in. Try online check in. I did not because their website is very bad.
2. BIGGEST PROBLEM is their website, booking tickets is difficult and then booking additional check in baggage was impossible. Since I had time, I went to their local office and got it done. Make sure you do it, otherwise you will pay a lot of money on the check in counter. Check in staff is not rude but not very helpful.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible experiences with Vietjet,"1) Delay announcement : 3/4 times flight got 1 or 2 hours delay. There is no any announcement to all passengers in ""advance"". What I got they announced the delay at boarding time or did not announce anything even the boarding time has passed!!! Passengers need to walk to see at the screen by themselves without any staff there. Just the empty gate...This is unacceptable.

2) 4 of us got luggage weight check 2 times. The first time was at check-in counter and the second time was in front the gate. Weight passed at check-in counter, but in front of the gate, staff asked us again to check the weight and they said it is over and need to be charged about 950000 VND. I did not mind about money, but why the process of checking is not the same. Why need to be duplicated process with different standard. At the check-in using standard machine. On the other hand, at the gate using local weighting apparatus. It is quite not fair and is not reliable.

3) Customer services: When I asked staff why you need to check weight at the gate again? Because I think it is really waste of time at the moment 2 hours delay..  staff gave us the answer with inappropriate voice, tone, and answer. She said she needed to check again and I need to pay for overweight. If I did not pay now, I will miss the flight because the bus is going out!!!!!!

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible customer service and approach,"Me and my friends found cheap flight tickets to Ho Chi Minh City over the weekend through VietJet. The flight from Hong Kong to Vietnam was no issue, but coming back was a terrible experience. We all passed the airline’s policy for 7 kg carryon-luggage on our way from Hong Kong. Going back however, all the sudden we had to put ALL of our bags together on the scale, backpacks and personal items included, which I’ve never experienced with any other airline. You either had to pay to check in your luggage, or wear your overweight as layers. 
Then, at the gate upon boarding, they had A SECOND weight check. They made many passengers pay more even though they passed the first time, for overweight after putting clothing items back in the bags, buying items in the tax free, etc. This entire procedure also resulted in our flight being even more delayed than the additional 50 minutes we had already waited.  

Essentially it felt like this airline doesn’t care about its customers. The staff argued in a disrespectful manner and caused additional delay, just to make an extra 30-50 USD for one or two kilos of overweight. Won’t be flying this airline again.",Date of travel: October 2019,

We flew from HCMC to Dalat, we were delayed 2 hours with taking off, once we were coming into land the pilot had to pull back up, we were unable to land so had to divert... back to HCMC. They unloaded us and told us we have to wait until 6.30am for the next flight, it is now 11.30pm. We asked to change onto the 5.45am scheduled fight as we were worried about them just adding a new flight, they agreed and gave us a new ticket. Then they shut the airport so kicked us onto the streets, no compensation or hotels, we found refuge in McDonald’s across the road until 4.30am when they finally reopened the airport. We checked in went through security and noticed they had changed our flight back to the 6.30am new flight which was now delayed until 8.30am. The 5.45am which we wanted to go on and had a ticket for before they changed it at the desk went on time..... Worst experience ever.

I had one computer bag and a hand bag total 2 pieces. The staff said to me I only allow one bag to the cabin. They said no the have to load one of my bag and I have to pay 30 USD for that. It’s not about the charge .It was the manner of the service agent. A woman who talked badly to me I told them I have the right for 2 bags the computer itself is already heavy. She told me if I have problem go talk to the manager . And gave a very fake smile. I was very angry of that behavior I could not understand how this Vietjet train their staff in such a bad manner. She could have just tell me professionally not behave like this. I ask her what her name was. She said to me to ask her manager and only the manager can ask what her name is!!!!!
I paid 30 usd because I see no use of any discussion with this kind of uneducated service staff from such a lousy way of treated the customer. Its a low cost airline! But the attitude of this staff is so low. That I felt so bad. 
This air line is not cheap! All in all.

As usual, flight changes and emails came to my mailbox starting days prior to departure and went on until original departure was overdue. In my case the change was less crucial, but I lost 3 hours due to the continuous delays. What I don’t like is that their emails are repetitive, robot generated, and irresponsible. All their emails do not provide clear changes and do not list old but only new itinerary. Often there are no changes but they cause stress and confusion. Duplicating emails needs also to be very carefully checked as one never knows what/if/how/how much/why has been changed. In this case they cancelled flight VJ306 6 days before departure and put me on VJ304 80 minutes later. That took them 5 emails to communicate. Further delays of new flight added 2 hours delay. Check-in and baggage went fine. I got the best seat onboard without requesting, 11D. Have never paid for excess hand luggage with this airline which contradicts several other reviews. The gates for this carrier is in Saigon clustered into a big hall which is messy and overcrowded like a bus station in a 3rd world country. Always tedious bus gating with lengthy queues, shortage of busses, and long outdoor waits. In the sky they are faultless with fresh crew, clean cabins, and inexpensive catering with many options. This flight was full but CC were handling all passengers perfect. VietjetAir is complicated, tedious, expensive, and risky until you are on board.

- Ground staff. Was not sure if they were trained to be rude to the customers or they were just incompetent and have decided that they are trained to be both rude and incompetent.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Low budget but watch out for flight cancellations or being rescheduled without notice,"We booked Vietjet to fly up from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi and it is what you would expect of a budget airline. The seating and facilities are no frills, but totally adequate for a 2hr flight. On-board announcements were in both English and Vietnamese, so we were able to know what's happening at all times. 

These are my recommendations:
(1) Be vigilant in checking your flight status before your flight date. I discovered by accident that the flight I booked had been cancelled and we had been put on a different flight without getting any emails.

(2) Vietjet's airport shuttle was rubbish - get your hotel to pick you up. We stayed in the Old Quarter and asked to be dropped off at the Quang Trung St stop. Our bus driver did not bother going to the last couple of stops and instead drove another route to the bus depot and just told us to walk back. It was 35mins of walking in hot humid Hanoi, and dragging our luggage around unruly traffic. Not. Happy.

(3) Be vigilant in checking your flight's gate and boarding status at the airport screens. SGN airport don't make announcements any more and our gates changed after check in and before boarding so don't get caught out!

I wanted to upgrade the baggage allowance. Then they advised for handling fee and etc. The staff emphasized that I might incur huge charges if I have it at check in counter. So apparently they have cheap prices to attract customers then have a lot of rules on baggages and etc. The weighing scale is different per counter. When I first weighed my baggage, it was 29 kgs.

Got various texts communications informing us that the flight is delayed due to operational issues but not really specifying the reason so that was quite frustrating. So the departure time changed from 20.30 pm to 22.55 pm then  00.35 am then 2.15 am then 3.10 am and finally 3.50 am. So in total 5 different rescheduling which really messed up our plans for the next day in Hanoi. 
When arriving at the airport, no apology or what so ever from the staff. We had to go enquire at the counter, the staff barely spoke english so that didn’t really help. We asked for some sort of refund or compensation and we received a refund of 25% approximately of the price and food Vouchers to be used inside the terminal. However since it was late night, only one of the four options was open so it didn’t leave us with any choice.
I would not recommend this airline at all since when being on holidays you don’t need such hassle to complicate your trip.

Absolutely trash airline with rude staff. They will extort you for more money at the check-in counter. One check-in staff Truong Minh Trang at HCM airport check-in robbed me of 30 USD, daylight robbery for extra check-in luggage. I have traveled to 9 countries multiple times this year with the same one small luggage and one backpack setup with practically the same weight throughout and have NEVER had to pay for extra check-in baggage. A ""cheap"" flight just became 60% more expensive. What's more, they have a cheap wet-market weighing scale at the boarding gate (I am not even kidding) to make sure your carry-on bag is less than 7kg. I gave the staff a death stare and I swear they did the right thing to turn a blind eye. I would have reprimanded them and shown them my wrath if they ever dared to even consider touching my backpack. I saw that the couple behind me at the boarding gate queue had to pay extra fees because their bag was over 7kg. They will hold your flight ransom again until you pay the extra fees in USD same as at the check-in counter. In the end the flight was delayed for exactly 2 hours. The flight attendants only arrived at the boarding gate to prep the plane 10min before the flight was supposed to takeoff. I would NEVER take Vietjet Air even if you gave me flights for free. People should be paid to fly with Vietjet Air to even consider it as a compensation for utter crap service and multiple fees extortion. Absolutely utterly trash SCAM AIRLINE.

I am disputing the extra baggage fee charge and am highly confident I will get my well deserved and only logical chargeback refunded to my credit card. Even then, the chargeback doesn't come close to fully compensating for the resources wasted and horrible experience many first (and last) time customers have to go through with this SCAM AIRLINE. 

Go onto Trustpilot, TripAdvisor, Skytrax and other credible review sites. There are so many other horrible one star experiences with this airline. FLY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

We have purchased one piece for the flight go.  On the day we have to fly back to Bangkok (departure 1725).  We wanted to book the same weight luggage, found something unclear on the check in site.  So I have called them up since 7:30 in the morning (answering machine said please hold the line, someone will be with me shortly)  I have called twice, both calls I have waited 45 and 28 minutes.  Nobody answered.  I contacted their facebook page, someone has answered me but when I asked the question about the luggage, they stopped to response.  So we decided to go to the airport earlier in order to make it clear.  We arrived at noon, tried to find their office.  I, at the end contacted one of their staffs and was told that we don’t have to worry, we have purchased already, please sit and wait until the counters are opened.  If they would have told me that we need to purchase one piece, I could have enough time to book online (it was longer than 3 hours prior departure).  So have waited until the counters are opened (we were the first passengers on the queue).  Check in started, they told me that we didn’t purchase check in bag, so airport rate!  I have explain everything in detail to the supervisor, he told me that they couldn’t do anything now, we have to purchase the airport rate and because of the inconvenience caused, we will get the difference back.  He provided the contact email address as well as his name.

In the previous flight, I was one of the last people to board the plane and when I got to my seat, the cabin space was taken. I immediately told an attendant to help me clear up some space for my bag but he refused and told me to put my bag in my leg-room. I was astonished because my hand luggage size was no joke but he didnt do me a favor. My latest flight was much better because the attendants help passengers organize the hand luggage in the cabin so that everyone gets enough space.

Most of the others have starved to death, the last of us have resorted to cannibalism. This is the 4th delay with VietJet, each longer than it’s predecessor. At least 2 days ago when we were forced to buy tickets with another airline, vietjet only pushed our flight back 9 hours. This time I’m afraid, we weren’t so lucky.

My group and I have survived our trek throughout Southeast Asia. It isn’t our first time, most of us seasoned travelers. Never have I experienced such disregard for human life than this airline. We have begun formulating a theory that they don’t actually have planes- just gestapo customer service statues trained in the art of showing anti-empathy. It’s not that they lack it, they have received iron crosses for their expertise in its counter part, apathy.

So I did the unthinkable. A man, lost in desperation I approached the graveyard of reapers. It was so cold. 

“One foot in front of the other” I told myself. My voice was so shaken, I hadn’t heard it in days. 

I approached one of the nine.

“May I speak to a supervisor please?”

I expected what you might, a minotaur like creature to charge through the back wall. Some ancient demon.

They just want to find ways to extort you while providing extremely POOR service with constant delays and rude staffs. Our morning flight was delayed several times making us lose an entire day. When we arrived at the airport, their counter was chaotic and the line was out the door. When we finally made it to the counter to check in our bags, they told me that our names did not match our tickets. That is because we only wrote our first and last name and not our middle name(s). I was born in Vietnam so I have 4 names to my name which I never write down. I have traveled to countless places from all around the US, to South America, to Europe, and to other Asian countries and I always book my tickets with just my first and last name, never have I ever written out my entire name and never have I ever had a problem until Vietjet. As for my boyfriend, it was the same, we only wrote down his first and last name but not his middle name. They told us that since we only listed our first and last name on our booking, they're unable to confirm that we are the same people who are checking in. Which is RIDICULOUS! Here are 2 Americans with 2 American passports and 2 Visas stating the same name! Yet they told us that they can't confirm that we're the same people checking in. They took us out of the long line that we had waited in and made us wait in another line while our flight was about to take off in less than 30 mins! They added on my boyfriend's middle name to the ticket but they said they can't fix mine since I have 4 names so they're not capable of adding two middle names. So they cancelled my ticket and made me buy a brand new ticket which obviously cost more. Then made us go to another line to request to check my bag then to another line to pay for the check bags. It was insane. There was a different line for everything that we needed to do. So we obviously missed our delayed flight but lucky for us since Vietjet is so terrible that our flight was even further delayed so we ended up catching it. During this whole experience, the staffs were extremely rude and unprofessional. There was no language barrier as I was able to speak to them in Vietnamese and she spoke to me like I was trash.

To beginning with the airline changed our flight 3 times in the 24 hours leading up to the flight. Originally it was 1030, then 1005, then 0930 and then 0700. Had we not had internet connection, we would never have received these emails which was definitely the case for several people on the flight who subsequently missed their flight.  We then had a second flight form Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh which was changed 7 times in 24 hours before the flight, from 1645 and in the end did not take off until 0250 - some passengers were at the airport waiting for 9 hours as they did not receive the emails (some of which weren't even sent out until about 2.5 hrs before the flight anyway so many people would've already been heading to the airport).  This is apparently very common and should be expected on most VietJet flights according to most of the locals I have spoken to. As a pilot myself I was very interested in hearing what people had to say so asked a good 8-9 people who all said the same. 

The most concerning thing for me however was the standard of the cabin and cabin crew. Yes, in most cases the cabin itself is just superficial, and some wear and damaged isn't necessarily related to safety. However, it was the level of dirtiness that struck me. Armrests were hanging off, tray tables broken, the smell was appalling, and there were sick spatters on many of the seats from previous flights.  The cabin crew had no situational awareness whatsoever, which resulted in them still handing out sick bags and some water whilst we were sat on the runway ready to go. The pilot had to make two announcements to get them to sit down.  Genuinely as a pilot, it was one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen and to be honest would not fill me with confidence as to the ability of the cabin crew to deal with an emergency.  Even for LCC airlines, safety should never ever be comprised and should always come first.   Having said this, we did fly a second time with VietJet and the cabin crew and plane itself were much better. 

Overall, avoid travelling with VietJet. Go Vietnam Airlines, take the train, walk if you really have to. But trust me, as our hotel receptionist said when we checked in at 0530 in the morning, ""ah yes VietJet, everyone only makes that mistake once!""",Date of travel: August 2019,

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst Airline I've Ever Encountered for service and safety,"First holiday into Vietnam, we thought we would use their budget airline for all local transfers.

They say you judge a company's performance not by when things go well, but rather how they respond when things go wrong.  If that were the case, Vietjet is one airline you should try to avoid.

We have had 3x domestic flights with this carrier and every single one of them has been delayed without any excuse other than plane is late. 

The reason for writing this article is because I've got another 5hrs up my sleeve after already waiting for 4hrs since I got to the airport. 

Interestingly enough, there appears to be no flight for this airline heading for Hi Chi Minh until 8.45pm.  So it's not just our flight.... thought perhaps weather related... but Vietnam Airlines have flights departing... Upon reading some news articles, it appears that Vietjet are having issues with rostering overworked pilots who have exceeded their max allowable flight hours and have been juggling staff and pilots and this has been going on for years and still continues as they have the worst statistics for delayed flights in the country...hmmmm starting to worry about getting on plane.

We went to look for a counter to speak to someone.. does not exist on the airside part of the airport.  Had to go back out to speak to someone. Great way to avoid frustrated customers...😁

When we decided to head back outside,  This was what they had to say:
1) we give you food voucher
2) or return value of fare
3) or compensate you $30 for 2 people
4) or you buy another airlines ticket
5) or wait until your flight comes

Such appealing options considering you've paid much more for your hotel room at your destination and would like to get there to use it...😔 or perhaps risk missing a connecting flight.

I find it quite interesting that there is such lack of duty of care.  I understand that with a budget airline there are no frills, bells or whistles and if you miss the flight time, it's your own fault and you forfeit your fees, but surely when things go the other way round, they have to be legally and financially held to account.

Pay more and fly another airline, but if you're not concerned about time and delays then stick with them.

As for their flight crew...they are just going through the motions.  On our delayed flight 😂 from Hanoi to Da Nang, a child maybe 10yo decided to unbuckle and walk to the back of the plane just as the pilot put the peddle to the metal for takeoff.  The crew member at the front of the cabin did nothing as the kid went from a slow stroll down the aisle to a warp speed sprint with passengers yelling and screaming as this kid went flying towards the back.  Fortunately a passenger put his hands out and caught the child halfway down the back.  There was a steward sitting two rows in front of us facing backwards towards us and all he did was rolled his eyes and shook his head. I really do not think this airline gives a toss about safety either by the way they flaunt aviation regs and have such poorly trained staff on board planes.

I could go on forever as I wait here for my flight, but I hope you get the picture...  On a less important note in my view, yeah some of their planes are really new and clean like the last one I took, but an earlier one also smelt like a urinal when we boarded from the back of the plane...",Date of travel: August 2019,

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst airline ever,"Note - we had the worst flight experience and this is a detailed review to highlight the INCOMPETENCIES of Vietjet

We had a flight from Bangkok to Phuket which was supposed to depart at 6 pm. We received an email from the airline stating that the flight is delayed to 7 pm. So we decided to check in at 5.15 pm. However, upon enquiring at the check in desk we were told that the flight has not been delayed (so what was the email for????). The lady at the counter claimed that the flight schedule changed again (and they didn't bother to inform their passengers - probably because they want to extort money from passengers who miss their flights because of their pathetic communication). Our baggage was 1 kg excess and she kept telling us to reduce the weight immediately (which we were doing, but she wouldn't let go of that even though she knew that there just wasn't enough time). On top of that, she spoke so rudely and kept saying ""hurry up hurry up, the check in counter will close"" (and is that our fault that you decided NOT TO TELL US that the flight schedule changed yet again?!) Once we checked in the lady at the counter then had the audacity to rudely tell us to move ahead and go to another counter to drop off our baggage (which nobody at the airport was able to guide us to and we ended up running across the airport with hand baggage with us). Finally after taking a full round of the Bangkok airport check in counters, we found the baggage counter. This was when we had only 15 minutes left for boarding gates to close. We ran with whatever energy we had left after this terrible experience (all thanks to Vietjet and its staff) and reached the boarding gate. We waited for a few minutes to catch our breath and headed towards the gate. There was a long line (which meant that they hadn't started boarding yet - strange at 5.45 for a 6 pm departure right?). A group of disgruntled passengers with us (we weren't the only ones with such an experience) asked the staff at the gate and they said that ""boarding hasn't started because the flight is PROBABLY delayed"". How in the world is there no communication between the staff at the check in counters (where we were rudely attended to and told that counter is almost closed) and the boarding gate?!. After 10 minutes there was an announcement that our flight was delayed to 7.15 pm (which this pathetic airline wasn't sure of till all their passengers were waiting at the boarding gate 10 minutes before departure). I really wonder how they got a license to operate and extort customers with their check in baggage rules and pathetic communication with the passengers. 
I strongly suggest to BOYCOTT this airline at all costs as you will have the worst airline experience ever with them.

Staff - rude and incompetent

Communication with passengers - can I give them less than zero rating?

Firstly, our original 06:00 flight from Danang to Ho Chi Minh (VJ621) was delayed by 1h45m and this meant that we would miss our connecting flight which departs at 09:00. We emailed the airline for a change of flight to VJ633 and even asked our hotel receptionist to phone them repeatedly but the customer service team has never responded till today. We then travelled all the way to Danang airport a day before our flight and our refund request was rejected by the staff as the delay was less than 3h. To be honest, we would never have to ask for refund should they reply to our emails and calls within 3 business days WHICH WAS STATED IN THEIR AUTOMATED MAIL. We then resorted to our last option which meant booking an entirely different and more expensive Business Class flight with another airline (no other seats were available). 

At the HCM airport, the VietJet Air airport staff started picking all the passengers who had suitcases and weighed all of them with the old-school weighing scale. Any bags that were heavier than 7kg would be charged the exorbitant baggage fees.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst airline I’ve ever flown with,"Having flown vietjet at least 10 times I can safely say they are the worst airline in existence. The fact they are still in business honestly blows my mind. This review is based on my experience on all of the flights I’ve taken - not just this flight.

On all flights taken, the flight has either been changed to a different time beforehand or has been delayed whilst in the airport.

 For changes made beforehand, passengers are not asked if the time change works for them, the change is simply stated as fact. When I have tried to contact them to tell them the change doesn’t work for me the phone lines are busy and they cut me off. I have frequently had to change my plans to fit around the changes they have made to my flight.

If the flight actually stays on schedule up until the time you make it to the airport, you can almost me guaranteed it won’t leave on time. Most of the time this isn’t even announced - boarding will happen at the time (or later) that you’re supposed to be flying and you will wait on the runway for at least 15-30 minutes. On top of this it’s very common to see official delays of up to 4 hours with only ‘a soft drink’ offered by way of apology.

As if all this wasn’t enough, in general the service is awful. You’re shoved into a seriously overcrowded bus to transport you to and from the plane and the planes are small, hot and uncomfortable

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Never again,"I have used VietJet about a dozen times. My flight has been delayed by at least one hour *every* *single* *time*. It’s become a running joke in Saigon that anyone who flies with VietJet will simply accept that they’re going to leave at a different time to the one they planned. 

They never inform you in advance. They know the flight won’t leave on time but they wait until the last minute to tell you. For my last flight they texted me the night before to change the time to an hour earlier. I had to cancel work arrangements. Then I got to the airport and it was delayed past the time it was supposed to leave before they changed it!

They just do whatever they want. They never change. They make no effort to stop being so late all the time.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Baggage charges not well displayed on the website sitting between optional food additions - often delayed,"There are two problems with this airline. Firstly, when you book online the price charged suddenly changes because of baggage fees. You pass through the process, skip paying extra to pick an ordinary seat and see a load of food pictures. If you are not a fan of overpriced airline economy food then you will just skip to the bottom. The issue is that the default 20kg of baggage charges for each leg is sitting there practically hidden.

I expect many users will miss these charges given the position they are in, on a page almost entirely dedicated to the food choices you probably don't want!

If you are not vigilant you will end up paying for baggage you don't need. Since prices are subject to a range of fees, admin fees, service charges and taxes, you easily miss the charge for the baggage has been added.

The second issue is that the flights are often delayed - about 50% of the time judging by our various flights using the carrier.

Lastly, the customer service is absolutely appalling - I am currently sitting on the phone to their service desk number - 40 minutes so far listening to an inane song titled 'I want to fly to open up my eyes'.

The opening of the eyes needs to be on their booking page rather than anything else!

When you eventually get on a plane the service is about on a par with the rest of the budget carriers.

So the customer service desk is only open until 10pm and time is about out - call was not answered and I am giving up trying!

This Vietnamese company is everything but reliable and should be banned from running domestic flights in Thailand. 

I booked 3 flights between Chiang Mai and Bangkok over a year and I've had 3 bad experiences. First time was in October 2018 from BKK to Chiang Mai, the flight was delayed by 2 hours without any information/reason. Second time was last July, the company changed the flight schedule by 3 hours. Although they sent me a prior notification about the schedule change, I was left without any option and was certainly not allowed to cancel my booking. However, I needed to book another flight and rely on this company for the coming 8th of August, since all the other airlines were fully booked or overpriced. My bad! They've just changed the schedule again from 16:10 to 19:20. I live in Hua Hin and the last airport bus to Hua Hin leaves at 18:30, which leaves me with only one option: Hiring a taxi from the airport to Hua Hin, which will cost me an additional 2,500 THB. I tried to cancel my reservation to no avail. 
They're not even able to edit proper boarding cards. During my last trip to Chiang Mai last July, the boarding pass showed Gate B8 as the boarding gate, which doesn't even exist at Suvarnabhumi Airport! I had to walk all the way back to the B1 gate which was the actual boarding gate. 
This is an horrendous airline, not to mention their terrible service, unfriendly staff and lack of communication.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nonstop Nightmare - Worst Airline I've Ever Flown,"Hubby and I have flown dozens of airlines, traveling through 40 countries the past 15 years. NEVER have we had such a horrific experience with an airline, anywhere else in the world. And this after paying extra for priority treatment.

The first issue was priority check-in. There were a total of 4 people in line ahead of us, yet it took 45 minutes for us to reach the desk. Then there were no paper luggage tags available, and Hubby's had torn off.  We had to beg the desk clerk to tape it onto the bag tag, so his bag would have some ID.

Second - we'd already prepaid extra money during booking to fly with 25K of baggage per person instead of 20K, and then ended up paying an additional $65 USD at the counter because our carry-on bags were overweight.  Prior to VietJet, never once has an airline weighed our carry-bag. This company advertises the cheapest fares on the internet, and then they bleed your pocketbook at time of travel. But this is just the beginning of the nightmare.

Our international flight was scheduled to depart Ho Chi Minh at 11:25 a.m. No gate attendant bothered to show up until 11:05, and then she sat in a chair ignoring passengers until 11:28, at which time passengers lined up like cattle to board a shuttle bus to the plane, which had no gate. 

I was totally taken aback when our ""red-tagged"" carry-on bags were weighed AGAIN at the departure gate. The red tag meant that it was approved at check in. The idiot at the departure gate that weighed our bags for the second time - on a rinky-dink little manual scale, no less - pulled us out of line and informed us the bags were overweight. We explained that we'd already paid for overweight carry-on bags, and that they were obviously tagged as approved by the check-in attendant. Yet this brilliant employee called a supervisor, who required that we explain the entire situation again.  

After ten minutes of rehashing the entire story with someone who doesn't understand English very well, we were finally allowed to board the shuttle, after the gate attendant pulled up our tickets in the computer system and confirmed that we'd paid $65 for overweight bags. Good thing we weren't at the back of the boarding line when this all went down, or we might have missed the flight entirely, like another unfortunate young lady did who was on our flight.  

Two days prior, she'd showed up at the VietJet check-in counter and had to pay $200 USD for her overweight bags. Then at boarding, her carry-on was weighed again, and she wasn't allowed to board because the attendant also claimed it was overweight. She actually missed her flight and wasn't able to get another flight for two days, which cost her two nights additional hotel expense in Ho Chi Minh. The second time she checked in at VietJet, they demanded she pay ANOTHER $50 for her bags, despite having paid $200 on Sunday. What a disgusting rip-off.  But you have no right to argue with ""authority"" in a communist country, so don't even think about contradicting the airline staff.

The nightmare wasn't half over yet. We booked exit row seats, and Hubby was reprimanded before take-off by a flight attendant because his toe was touching the exit door.  He was also told he couldn't use a digital camera (not a phone) to take photos out the window. The attendants have all been trained as little commie dictators. In exit row seating, my knees still barely cleared the seat ahead, and I'm only 5' 5"" tall. 

Our 11:25 flight finally lifted off at 12:22 p.m.  Drinks and snacks are available only for cash purchasers. No plastic is accepted. And you can't get a complimentary cup of water.  There are no video screens in the plane, nor is there any wi-fi. Screen addicts be aware - your phone must be turned of while in flight.

The icing on the cake - this is the first airline I've ever flown that has no seat protectors for the toilets.  Bottom of the barrel, bare bones, trash class flying, from start to finish.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't ever fly,They will find something amiss and ask you straight to buy new tickets. You won't get any refund for your already booked ticket and will get the same flight and seat for your new ticket. The executives will be heartless and won't listen to you. They won't even smile at you. There is no point explaining. I had to buy new tickets even after I had all the immigration check with the same details I have given to them. I felt those executives like vampires. I opted this only because of the low fare despite reading several negative reviews.

Normally, no other airline cares. No one checks if your phone is in airplane mode so why does my phone need to be off during landing and take off? That was something weird I noticed that awoke my spidey senses. The return trip to Ho Chi Minh was ridiculous. My flight was for 9 and I got to the airport at 2pm. I knew it was too early to check in so I inquired about the flight around 4 only to hear of its one hour delay. I went to a restaurant and was that annoying customer who bought stuff and stayed til 6ish. I inquired about the flight and it was delayed another hour. At this point, I'm mad. I'm also traveling with a family. My uncle went to the flight desk and said ""Can you tell why the flights are delayed?"" They had no answer other than ""oh, the flights in Saigon are 2 hours late"" Like how? Because he went up there so much they got us flights for 8:45 which was like 15 minutes before the original flight. Like how did they manage to get 5 tickets magically for an earlier flight you ask? I don't even know. There was no order. Everything felt chaotic. The chairs on the flight are really small and if you were a decent human, you wouldn't recline it but people do, unfortunately.

Low and behold my bag had miraculously gained weight to 9kg and my wifes was now 7kg. I advised the young man that I could remove my iPad and carry case if he would allow me. The answer was no your over weight so must pay. I advised him that every female who had a cabin case also had a handbag but again I was refused. The outcome was that I had to pay an additional $44 US to be allowed to take my bag. I consider myself a level headed and reasonable person, but to be singled out as a European traveller who could pay extra is blatant racisim. None of the Vietnamese or Thai travelers were singled out for this treatment, but of course I would have money to pay. To add insult to injury when I gave him the $45 he told me that he had no change. I suppose that's a $1 tip for him.

From hcmc to danang, scheduled departure 28 June 2019 at 6.15am.

@vietjet
Delays happen and we (passengers) have full understanding. However, since you choose to cooperate with flyone, you might wanna choose an airline that has some sense of commercial acumen.
Here is the experience we had with flyone.
Departure was scheduled for 6.15am, and at 6.25am they boarded a group of late comers. Are you telling us that in future passengers can board with such a huge delay if we choose a vietjet flight which is operated by flyone?
Now, the delay might not be within their control (which they would claim anyhow when we complain). Ok, to give you all a benefit of doubt! but from a commercial perspective and for the sake of customer experience, what was within your control was to proactively let those 99% of the compliant passengers know that departure would be delayed by estimatedly xyz mins (because of whatever reason you could just make up in that moment!)
This is such a basic and damn basic common sense in business!
Flyone chose NOT to do it! Instead, they let disappointed passengers sit there and voice sad monologues (especially elderly ones) who were counting down minutes to see their family and/or friends. Moreover, they refrained passengers from using the toilet. This was really bad for those who have weak bladder/stomach (again, especially the elderly ones). 
Departure was at 7am (finally)where we could be landing in danang already...
Hence I was wondering: 
1. they didn’t inform passengers due to their disrespect for the Vietnamese passengers (They didn’t even display a courtesy to apologize properly) or 
2. Vietjet doesn’t expect any customer-focused behavior from them anyway...
If it’s due to the first reason, intelligent vietjet management would know what to do (I guess). If due to the latter, vietjet management has a very shortsighted business thinking! 
As you already know, customers have a very huge Choice! And it’s even bigger in the future!

@ passengers 
You might want to check which airline operates the flight when you choose to book with vietjet!!!!!

We would have to get a visa so that we could go through immigration and customs in Hanoi in order to get our bags, then re-check them and go back through immigration to go to our gate at the Hanoi Airport. No one had notified anyone of this nonsensical policy before. Everyone atound us was screaming at the Vietjet employees. A family of 5 next to me was stranded because they did not have an extra $1,000 USD to buy the visas for all family members. It was just horrible. 

We had a lot of extra hassle and expense that negated the savings of flying with Vietjet. Their communication and lack of customer awareness through this whole procezs was miserable. It really placed a nwgative cloud on top of an otherwise delightfully tranquil trip.",Date of travel: June 2019,

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Good Budget airline,"I have flown many times with Vietjet and I love flying with them. Yes, they are always delayed, usually less than one hour late, but that is not an issue for me. What worth to fly with them is how much I paid for, they fly with newer planes = clean, the staffs are professional, hot food ordering for an affordable price. If you planned ahead it works out just great. I just booked a ticket from Bangkok to Phuket for $26 USD which included tax, surcharge, and transaction fee. I can't really go wrong with this.  Most of the budget airlines depart in Bangkok at the DMK, but VietJet flies out at BKK which is another adding bonus for me. If I found a comparative fare offer by the full-service airline, of course, I will book with them, but most of the time, they are two or three times more than what I would pay for Vietjet air. 

I see many people complained. They should come to the US and try to fly with spirit airlines, you will appreciate flying with VietJet.

I should have listened to the thousands of complaints against Vietjet before booking with them. The thing with this airline is it's cheap and convenient to fly throughout Vietnam, but that is precisely the problem with Vietjet. It's cheap - which means ZERO customer service. Our flight was overbooked and they refused to let us check in. We spoke to the manager on duty, Hoang Pham Thuy Vi, who was completely rude and unprofessional. Not only did she not provide an answer as to why our family, in particular, could not board the flight, but she had the audacity to raise her voice at me and my mother when we were speaking to her in Vietnamese. When I started to complain in English (my native tongue), she couldn't say a word as her English needs a lot of improvement. I would never fault someone for not being able to speak English, but as the manager working at an international airport, she should be equipped with basic English skills to converse with foreign customers. 

I filed a lengthy complaint online with Vietjet and have yet to hear back from them. I demanded a full refund for the time and money they have cost our family, and an apology for the unprofessionalism provided by their staff, particularly the manager. Their last email said they would give me an answer by the end of the week and that was over a month ago - still no response. 

There is sooooo much more I could say on what a nightmare this airline is but you've been warned: should any problems arise while flying with them, just know they will treat you with zero respect.

Wanted to fly one way from Cam Ranh Airport / Nha Trang to Da Nang. 2 airlines do this route - Vietnam Airline : USD 42 vs VietJet : also USD42 (include 1 checked-in bag - USD6.9, seat selection - USD1.8 and insurance - USD2.6, the air tic itself was less than USD9!!! Rest is tax. 

So either way price wasn't the deciding factor but the departure time was, Vietjet's flight was 12:10pm, Vietnam Airline was 7:15am, as I stayed in a resort which is 1.5 hours away I didn't want to wake up at like 4am so decided to 'risk it' with VietJet.

Booked the air tic from the website, no problem. 

Have to say was pretty worried pre-flight given all the bad reviews here and price of the air tic was not even USD10, it is a short 1-hour flight but still, the price was unbelievably low. No expectations whatsoever but really, have to say the flight and experience were very decent for a no frill airline. Check-in was reasonably efficient taking into account local standard, checked-in 1 suitcase and handcarry 1 small suitcase with no problem, plane was clean and pretty new, tight space but not a biggie as it was a short flight anyways, flight departed and arrived on time, luggage arrived in 1 piece so really, zero complaint from me and one happy passenger.",Date of travel: May 2019,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}]"

That was a very frustrating and unexpected experience and I now have compassion for the previous travellers who found themselves in the same situation and those who will have to deal with that unfair cost at the airport in the future. It is simply an unintelligent approach to customer satisfaction to charge customers half of their airline ticket at the airport for checking-in a light baggage. When one spends 60$ on a flight ticket one almost always never expect to pay another 30$ at the airport to check in a small luggage.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disaster-jet,"This is the worst airline you can possibly imagine. We stupidly booked 5 separate flight legs with them as we traveled through Vietnam, and cursed ourselves for it the entire time. 

--The Good--
The planes fly, some are even new.
Pilots are professional and do a rather good job with announcements.

--The Bad--
In case you haven't picked up on it yet, this airline is categorically late, on every single flight, without exception. 

Our initial leg was booked from ICN to HAN and was delayed 12 hours! We decided to forfeit that fight and ran to Asiana ticket counter to book another flight on the spot. 

Another massive issue is their online check-in. We checked in online for the internal Vietnamese flights (they don't allow online check-in for international). So you get to the gate no problem (Vietnamese security is a total joke) and of course you get absolutely no communication about the flight arrival, priority boarding, or anything else. 

We payed for priority boarding but it's just a scam. You simply wait there until all of a sudden, everyone rushes the gate at the first sight of activity behind the counter. 

Then they start boarding and if you happened to check-in online, they pull you side, AT THE GATE, and start weighing your carry-on baggage. They don't do this BEFORE boarding, they do it WHILE boarding. 

They weight your bags on a manual Soviet-era scale and of course you're overweight because their weight restriction is 7 kilos, for all bags combined! 

So there you are, at the gate, people filling though, boarding an already-late flight, and you're being held up at the gate and shaken down for money, while they insist you check in the bag. After some haggling and lots of stress, they charged us and we carried-on as planned. This whole affair occured on 2/4 flights we took with them. So there's another issue: consistency. 

The boarding process is also a mess. Completely disorganized, everyone rushing down the isle, crew with no control, etc. It might be more a Vietnam thing than a VietJet thing, but it's basically a zoo. 

Finally, we get to the in-flight service. Crew are generally nice but seem tired and irritated. During the flight they dont do very much since there's no service other than selling gross food from the in-flight menu. 

Bottom line: this airline is total  scatology. The service, the people, the processes and the reliability are all bottom tier. 

If you can help it book something else, ANYTHING else.

The lady was super friendly and apologetic and advised that due to how soaked they were and the contents inside they would refund us the value of our backpacks... this was great as it meant we could buy new ones and hopefully salvage some stuff inside and pray that laundry would do the trick.

2 days later I received an email to thank me for my feedback and that we would be given £10 (£5 each) for our inconvenience???

We had no bags so had to spend more on accommodation for another 2 days waiting for laundry, also cancel a cruise we had planned for the next day and lost our deposit and they are happy to give us £5 each.

We have emailed back but not heard anything at all, nor have we received their suggested “generous” £10 compensation either.

In fact I checked in just after 14:00 and I wasn't due to fly until 21:15 later that evening but it got everything done nice and early so I could just relax and think about our fun times we'd had.

At 20:50 a member of staff for Vietjet came to the gate and wrote a revised time of 22:35 with the reason of ""Schedule Changes"" for the flight. Obviously nobody was expecting this and many were unhappy, however these things do happen from time to time but with no apology or additional information available, not even from Vietjets website this was just the start!

Finally at 23:00 the gate opened and everyone made their way to the bus that took us to the plane. After another 30 minutes pass after everyone is on the plane it finally takes off. 2 hours and 15 minutes late from its original flight schedule and just under an hour late for the revised schedule!!!

I along with all my fellow passengers were meant to land in Hanoi on Friday 10th May at 23:20!!! Not at 01:30 am Saturday morning when at this time of the night/morning taxi fares increase as do Grab fares do too!

When I contacted Vietjet about this they pushed me to the company I booked with, Trip.com & they're claiming it's Vietjet that's at fault & vice versa! I'll review Trip.com next depending if they can pull their fingers out of they're a**e and do something.

I'd used Vietjet twice before, both an hour late but this experience really took the biscuit. Absolutely shocking that this air service is still operating as it's the worst I've ever encountered. 

Avoid like the plague as they couldn't care less about peoples schedules, plans or connections etc! 

It also doesn't matter if you have a promo code for a cheaper flight, pay for economy or pay for priority. This is what you'll receive no matter what!

They only let you have 7kg carry on baggages including personal item bag (first time in my life, I experienced it). Our carry on baggages exceeds 7kg (2kg exactly),  so I'm willing to pay for the checked baggages. When I was asking how to proceed, the supervisor in red dress named Minh screamed at our faces as if we are criminals, asking us to place our personal items (my computer bag) on the scale. She treated us- first time customers in the rudest way. It was the most unpleasant experience in our entire life.

I noticed the counter staff name Nong thi Thuy was patient with us and her supervisor too, so it is the plus. But nothing can make up for our bad experience. Our first and last time with this airline. And if you do have some self esteem, you stay away from them.",Date of travel: May 2019,

No need to worry about trying to sleep!"" The cabin attendant didn't seem to care (of course he didn't...)

As for the flights, 4 out of 4 of them were late due to late arrivals. The departure time was pretty much the boarding time and then some. All the changes were never announced and there were mistakes with the boarding gates.

When Vietjet looked at our visa and discovered the incorrect port of entry into Vietnam from Thailand, they insisted we change our flight to the following day. They clearly stated that our flight details would be exactly the same, flying to Da Nang via Ho Chi Min City, only one day later. We paid the change fee for each our five family members. 
We checked in the next day and boarded our flight. On arrival in HCMC, we were told that the second leg of our flight had not been rebooked. We were forced to pay for this flight again, at a much higher rate than the original.
The representative assured us that this was a Vietjet error and we would be reimbursed when we emailed the company and let them know what had occurred. She gave us paperwork supporting our cause, which I forwarded along with our email.

Firstly the online booking system is archaic and does not work well. I was booking my air ticket and was at the payment stage when the system suddenly booted me out!

Then the check in counter is extremely sensitive about carry on luggage weight. And I was forced to pay SGD$40 to check-in my luggage for my SG to SGN leg then another SGD$20 for my SGN to HAN leg.

I paid for a more expensive ticket from SGN to HAN so that I can rest early tonight for my early meeting tomorrow and get some work done before I sleep. That’s not happening anymore!

My 2030hrs flight got pushed back to 2155hrs. We boarded by 2140hrs and it’s 2325hrs now and we’re still here sitting on the tarmac! After having almost a riot onboard, we deplaned and were sent back to the terminal. We eventually only took off again at 0200hrs. So much for the scheduled 2030hrs flight. 😄😄😄

Original scheduled arrival was 2235hrs. We’ve completely blown past that! I only arrived in Hanoi at 4am in the morning and had to go straight for my meeting after breakfast with no rest at all!

The icing on the cake is the explanation for the delay. Somebody on the operations side mistook the actual flight number VJ168 for VJ198 and thus ATC didn’t want to release the plane until it was sorted. That’s a major frack up by an airline. Seriously.

Apparently free food was distributed during the flight but I was so exhausted from being stuck at airports the whole day, I passed out for most of the flight.

This is well and truly THE WORST AIRLINE EVER! Fly with them at your own peril...you’ve been warned!

I know the budget airlines has tickets for 8 dollars, but due to reviews of space being a little small, I choose to upgrade to ""choosing"" my seat. I sat in 3A. It was $35. Skyboss is 100 ish

apparently the first 2 rows is what they call SkyBoss. its the equivalent of an econ plus in the states. The 3rd row has the same width and space as the first 2 rows. THe 3rd row costs extra because you get to choose these seats, but is not skyboss.  The rest of the econ seats were tight and lacked leg room. For this trip, 3 of my friends opted for SKYBOSS, 3 others including me had the seats in row 3 and the remainder 2 friends were in the back so im able to make a proper comparison.

The Skyboss tickets had their own private bus to the plane and did not need to wait online. once on the plane, skyboss tickets had some beverages. nothing special. flight was smooth and fast. The flight attendants noticed that we were all friends in the first 3 rows and informed us we can get on the private bus to the terminal first. Once we landed, we got to get off the plane first and go to the terminal before everyone else. The Skyboss luggage even came out before the remainder of the passengers got to the terminal. SkyBoss status was def treated like VIP. 

Im sure everyone has their own experience flying within Vietnam, but i will def take Vietjet air again but only Skyboss status.",Date of travel: March 2019,"[{'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}]"

3.0 of 5 bubbles,First time flying on VietjetAir,"My very first time flying on this Vietnam domestic airline from Ho Chi Minh airport was quite interesting indeed. 

Arriving at the Saigon SGN domestic airport departure hall for my flight to Da Nang was an eye opener for me. I was met with a very long queue at the VietjetAir check-in counters and had to wait in the common line queue for about 20 mins. When my turn came up, the check in counter staff was friendly and as I had one check-in baggage, I had to pay the baggage charges before I was able to collect my air ticket. 

Upon entering the departure hall, it was very crowded and looked like a big market place with full of passengers. Half an hour before flight time, I had to queue to board a bus which bring all the passengers to the aircraft in groups and this process took about half hour. The flight took off around 30 mins later from its original departure time and it was a smooth flight all the way to Da Nang. 

As it was an hour flight time, the service is normal and as expected from a budget airline. 

Upon my return flight from Da Nang airport, it was a much faster process for check-in due to lesser crowds and the take-off time was 30mins from its departure schedule. Arriving at SGN airport, the plane was parked on the tarmac for more than 35mins before all the passengers can disembark and waiting for the luggage took another 20mins. So if anyone wants to take a connecting flight, at least more than 3 hours allowance is needed upon landing at HCM, in order not to miss the connecting flight to the next destination.

Other than the waiting time, overall, it is quite a friendly airline to fly and good value for money and anyone who is on a tight budget, VIETJETAIR is the answer.",Date of travel: March 2019,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

No airline I have ever flown includes your personal bag in the carryon weight limit.

Of course the fee at the counter was outrageous - $30 US for one small bag. What was even more outrageous was the flight was literally half full. No weight issues there.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great! Don’t Understand Other Reviews ,"We had a great experience!
We prepaid for our checked bags ($5.25 for a 20kg bag - cheap!)
Flight was on time, crew was friendly, aircraft was fairly new and in great shape. 
A 2 hour flight for $146 including bags for 3 people. Same flight in North America would be $350 EACH. 
I couldn’t get over some of the previous reviews: Of course there would be communication issues, you are in another country, their country. Gate changes are the airport, not the airline. 
We as tourists seem to expect North America service, in English, but at a cheap smaller economy price. 
I was stunned at what we got for the price we paid. ",Date of travel: March 2019,"[{'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}]"

I also paid for a coffee, and of course there are no screens to watch a movie but the flight was really comfortable. The aircraft was new, and it was very clean.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City - VJ802,"There are many negative reviews of VietJet Air around the web. My personal experience is the exact opposite as VietJet Air is the best low cost carrier I have traveled with. The experience from booking online to arrival in Ho Chi Minh City was exceptional. I chose SkyBoss as I needed some flexibility in dates and this was well worth it, as I needed to change the dates, This was accomplished seamlessly via the website. The check-in at Suvarnabhumi was good and quick, with the provided fast-track card I was through screening and immigration in 20-minutes. The departure gate at G8 was a little far from the CIP lounge, access is part of the SkyBoss deal. The aircraft arrived slightly late. I was boarded first, the airport agents remembered me from check-in (kudos!) and the very pleasant cabin staff stored my carry-on. No-one questioned my carry-on at the gate or anyone else for that matter. The boarding process was very efficient and the cabin staff very clear in the safety rules (including asking passengers to switch off their phones). The flight departed slightly later than advertised, this is normal for any flight at Suvarnabhumi due to volume of traffic. I was given a bottle of water and peanuts prior to take-off and offered a meal from the menu card after take-of. I opted for a Saigon beer, which was very nice!! The flight landed slightly late, with effusive apologies from the cockpit! All-in-all a good trip. I will use VietJet Air again, that is the best review I can give.",Date of travel: March 2019,

However this staff member would not let me leave to get changed or re weigh my bag. She demanded money from me, not listening to any of the questions or explanations I was giving. She barked instructions at me whilst looking at me like a piece of dirt and said multiple times she ""doesn't have time for this"". If I was allowed to put my jumper and jeans back on my bag would be the acceptable weight again! This is unacceptable. I should be allowed to go to the toilet to change, and at the very least be allowed to open my OWN BAG and put my OWN CLOTHES back on!

Check in at phu quoc was a nightmare, long queues with no order and everyone trying to get in front.  Fortunately you can check in online when flying out from ho chi minh, so this was seamless if you only have hand luggage.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst airline I ever got my entire life !!!,"So I got a flight from Bang Kok (BKK) to Ho Chi Minh City (SNG) on 02/16/2019 at 2:00pm (local time). I got everything packed and ready to take off by 10:00am, after awhile they sent me email about the delayed of the flight and its new take off time was 4:00pm. Me and my friend came to the airport around 1:00pm as we lined up for check-in. That was a long line waiting at the airport and when we get so close to the counter, a woman from the company came and checked our passports. The only thing she said was “the counter is closed” and it was like 3:30pm. We were so pissed that they didn’t even sent any employees to come guide us or made an emergency line for us to aboard. All the displays above the check in counter was written in Thai and no flight # or anything that we can track out what line we should stand by. 

Well we missed our flight but that’s not a problem, we would have to change a new flight but when we came to the customer service all we got is that they said “wait till 7:00pm, pay penalty of 1409 bath/person”. We were so mad but couldn’t do anything, the employees’s attitude is just terrible - no guiding, no friendly smile, no communication skills. And we awared that the flight that we missed was also been delayed until 6:00pm. In the meantime I asked them that if we could still check-in to aboard but all they told us were “counter closed no more check-in” and their voice was just careless about what we were expected to hear. Again no guide for us what to do next, not even a sorry or a smile while we talking nicely to them.

Lastly their flights are always delayed by 80-90% and their flight’s history were : 5 emergency landing, 1 wrong landing , 1 crashed wheels while landing and 10,000+ delayed flights overall.",Date of travel: February 2019,
1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst experience I’ve ever had,"My boyfriend and I have been traveling through South East Asia and we are on our way down to Ho Chi Minh city. First, when we bought our tickets we had to wait for this group of people in front of us to deal with there problems and took 10 minutes to just get a boarding pass, also had to check one of our Carry On’s Which we never had to do on any of our other flights with small planes. That’s not the main reason I’m upset, when we had to get on a bus to the plane which is normal, They first tried to cram everyone on the bus which obviously they couldn’t do. Then we waited another 10 minutes on the bus without moving, they were having technical difficulties. If we would have gotten off the bus right than and waited it would have been ok, but instead they took us on a 20 minute slow ride around a couple planes and the driver was so bad slamming his breaks when he didn’t need to. And driving 2 miles an hour and stopping every 5 seconds. It was just the worst experience I’ve had to deal with for an airline.

No warning, no advice from the check in counter upstairs. I argued with the staff who refused to budge. They gave me a choice pay or don't fly. So after two flight delays and zero apology the gate crew added further insult by hitting up passengers for an extra gate fee.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,better than US domestic carriers,"We flew Vietjet 4 times in Asia - from HCMC to Hanoi, Hanoi to Bangkok, Bangkok to Phuket and Phuket to Bangkok.  

The flight from HCMC to Hanoi was a bit of mess - we received notification early in the morning that our flight was rescheduled to 8 pm instead of 2 pm.  This was annoying but gave us more time in HCMC so it was fine.  We go to the airport, checked in with no issues.  We pre-paid for our bags and seats so I had no issues with that.  

However, once we were waiting near our gate for boarding, there was an announcement we would be delayed an hour for mechanical issues.  Great, so we get up and walk around trying to kill some time and I looked at the screen randomly and boarding had begun! No announcement was made.  So we ran back down to board and were the last people to get on the bus to the plane.  Crazy.

We get on the bus and get the plane and then we don't get off.  They take us back to the gate on the bus and tell everyone to wait.  At this point, we are about an hour delayed. We wait on the bus for another 15 minutes and then they take us back to the plane and we board.  The plane is clean; the attendants are polite and nice and they all spoke English which was surprising.  Landing in Hanoi was fine.

Our flight from Hanoi to Bangkok was on time, with no issues.
The flight from Bangkok to Phuket was on time, no issues.
And lastly, the flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed about 30 minutes, which is nothing in the grand scheme of things.

Overall, Vietjet is better service than a typical US airline - I am having flashbacks to snippy Delta agents, rude Spirit staff and crabby United attendants... however, the planes are small - legroom is tight.  You do have to pay for drinks/snacks. No in flight entertainment but these flights tend to be short.

The experience pre boarding was unpleasant given that late arrival passengers seem to think it's normal to try and jump the queue to board the bus and then plane even though seat numbers are allocated.

It was truly horrible and dreadful. Our flight was at 9 o'clock and at 8:30 my family was waiting in line. One vietjet women told us to weigh our carry ons. We had an extra 3kg for 3 carry ons which was unacceptable because one carry one bag can only be 7kg. My little backpack and mu mom small handbag had to be involved in this and this is the first time. What upsets me most is the way she talks to the passengers. She was very rude towards my family and she talked loudly like she was some kind of princess. My family took out 1kg worth of clothes for every carry on bag. We took out 2 hoodies, water, and even threw away some gifts that we were going to five to my uncle. We weighed them again and 2 carry ons were 5.5 kg while the other was 6.5 kg. The vietjet women didn't look at the scale and carelessly told my family that we could NOT board the plane due to being too late. She booked us another flight tomorrow which was exactly 24 hours later. We had to pay and extra 3 million for that flight. While at the gate, I saw a young man and women boarding for Kuala Lumpur. They were blogging their trip with a Go Pro. The vietjet lady saw that she was in the footage and was scared that everyone would see what she had done which was shouting rudely to other passengers. She called the Airport police and convinced the young man and lady to delete their footage. They got on a van and was driven to their plane. They almost missed their plane.

In late November, I booked a check-in baggage online and did go through the process and paid by visa. No sign of the flight was cancelled at all. However, a moment later, I got a notification of flight cancellation from my online travel agent. I double checked the flight status with airline official website and flight was still scheduled. I thought it might only be a mistake and sent an email to travel agent for clarification.

The next day the agent confirmed the flight was cancelled and had me options of rebooking another flight or fully refund.

I wouldn't trust that online agent anymore, switched to another very reputable one, booked Vietnam Airlines with same price (1 stop at Honai).

Got full refund of airfare by online agent. Vietjet doesn't response to any of my calls, messagers and emails. I needed to go through Visa to dispute the transaction and still in process.

This event does not get me to write review yet.

In this Vietnam trip, I travelled with 13 friends from Hochiminh to Nha Trang on January 13. My friend booked us Vietjet VJ1694 depart 1205.

Unfortunately without any advanced notice or clue even when we checked in the airport, the airlines at its own absolute discretion to merge and combine 3 scheduled flights into one without any concerns of customers. We got boarding passes for Vj610 depart 1405. The one departing on 1305 also cancelled.

This Vietjet Airlines tends to show plenty of scheduled flights to choose, however you never know whether you can on time to fly, or even worse if you fly there for a connection!

My suggestion is choose another airlines if you have a choice!",,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}]"

However, the flight time was indicated not at 21.35, but at 10.30.
This was an absolute disaster, because at the time of receiving the message we were not in Hanoi, but in the city of Halong. And most importantly: for the time that remained until the previously scheduled departure at 21.35, we had ordered and paid for two excursions (through Halong Bay and to the Perfume Pagoda, 70 kilometers from Hanoi) and transfers and hotels corresponding to this order. These excursions and hotels were paid without the right to refund. Thus, a sudden change in departure time threatened us with a loss of more than 600 dollars.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unreliable, but once onboard quite OK","Domestic HUI-HAN 14th August 2018 on a new A320 aircraft. I had changed this ticket several times through own web booking management and through phone service. The change fees are so exorbitant that’s it’s often better to discard the first tickets and buy new. Whenever I make a change I lose all prepaid services (luggage meals etc.) and must pay these again for the new itinerary. The worst is the numerous emails one receives prior to departure on “possible schedule changes”: it is not clear whether there is change or not and they send again and again – very stressful as you assume there is a change but most often not. Worse are the frequent schedule changes and flight amalgamations that jeopardise plans and make travelling ridiculous. This time I had booked 6 months in advance – but 5 weeks prior to departure they relegated their morning flight to Hanoi making it difficult/impossible for me to use the ticket unless I went a day earlier and spent a night extra in Hanoi. That gave me serious other problems and I had to travel a day earlier to enable me to catch my connecting international flight from Hanoi. That proved difficult and costly. Useless airline unless you are lucky. However, “luck” counts a frequency of only 60-80% of my flights taken with them. I tend stick to Vietnamairlines and Jetstar on domestic travelling in Vietnam. Onboard, Vietjetair are absolutely fine with fresh staff and fair pricing. However, that faints compared to numerous delays, cancellations, and sudden schedule changes. Not an airline for busy professionals but at times it works fine, particularly if paired with patience. The prices are very reasonable if bought through campaigns or well in advance. But when it comes to travel day it will show whether it was worth the savings. They don’t want to “discuss” their own changes – they just assign a new time. In this case, eventually they pretend to pity me and extraordinary “allowed me” a single and unusual date change so I could be on time for onwards international flights. I decided to go with them as another ticket with Vietnam Airlines would now be expensive. It became a bumpy, and tedious process before all details were straightened out (e.g. they tend to cancel meal and baggage and add-ons if they reschedule the flight – just eating up passengers money in a shameful, aggressive behaviour. Flight was full, but service, and FAs onboard were fine, so eventually I had some luck. Onboard, I bought hot meals and drinks reasonably priced.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Fresh team onboard. Try SKYBOSS.....?,"Flew HUI-SGN on 2 Jan. 2018 on an A320. First time for me in their SKYBOSS “business class”. The price is 2-3 times higher as cattle class but includes lounge, 30 kg luggage, lots of hand-luggage, priority seats and gating, and free ticket changes. It was a late evening flight, which endured one of many reschedulings which are symptomatic for Vietjetair. This postponement was announced by three identical emails sent to me a week in advance. Still, we left an hour late, which is, according to flightradar.com, the normal situation for this VJ315 (daily) midnight flight: only 74% of the flights are on time (according to their displayed statistics). The last 2 weeks all of this particular flight have been delayed every day with 1-3 hours. For me, a minor delay was fine as I had to wait 1-2 hours anyway in SGN to be able to check in for next flight which leaves 5-6 hours later than VJ scheduled arrival time. Check-in opened 2 hours before departure and took me only 2-3 Minutes to get my BP. Lounge granted in Phu Bai Airport is very plain and understocked. However, they are kind and kept the lounge open only for me as I was the sole eligible visitor at these midnight hours. They even extended opening hours another 1 hour to cope with the 50 Minutes delay of my flight, VJ315. Onboard, I was given seat 1C and no-one was seated next to me. Got two choices of hot food and was provided drinks and towel. Food arrived with 2 Minutes after ordering (yes!). Fresh interior in cabin and energetic, young staff. Busgating in both ends with separate luxury mini-van just for me as the only SKYBOSS passenger went very quick with nil waiting time. My baggage arrived as the first one – it was nicely decorated with priority tags in sparkling colours. Product hardly worth the triple price of a discounted economy, but an interesting adventure with “full on board services”.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Changed flight time,"First, the actual flight from Hanoi to Can Tho wasn’t bad at all. The price was cheap and quality average. However, we booked an 8pm flight as we would be traveling from Ninh Binh area to the Hanoi airport the same day. They emailed a few days in advance that our flight had been changed to 3pm, in a very nondescript email that we did not see until 24hours in advance. Luckily we did see it! We had heard vietjet changes flights and cancels flights all the time so it wasn’t a shock, and we had not booked our transportation to the airport yet. We had to completely change our itenirary for ninh binh to accommodate the changes. I had planned it all out for months in advance. Despite all the planning, we are pretty flexible and did most of what we wanted to do and were able to make it from Tam Coc to Hanoi Airport in time (Left at 10am instead of 3pm). If you have a tight itinerary or are otherwise inflexible then I would recommend flying with a airline that is not known for changing plans constantly. Changing a flight time a few days in advance isn’t terrible, but I have heard they do much more last minute changes frequently as well. Plus the email did not stand out as important and was easily missed- especially while busy on vacation. 

Also, one of the employees at an info counter at the airport (working for VietJet) was kind of rude.

Flight was on time, staff were pleasant, take off and landing was smooth and checked baggage arrived very quickly at Hanoi .
Having said that, Vietjetair is definitelyy a 'no-frills' airline - smallish leg room (although my partner is 6ft and he wasn't uncomfortable) and no food included on the flight - but I had a very pleasant experience indeed.

When chatting with the locals, we were informed that it has a reputation for being late especially the flights after the morning.  While it was substantially cheaper than Vietnam Airlines, we would advise against booking unless you first check recent reviews and see what folks have to say about punctuality.  We also had two minor issues.  We booked through an international website and we could not check in online through the Vietjet website.  We had to do that in person - that went smoothly at the airport. The second issue was that in Hanoi we had some trouble checking in as we had not included our middle names on the booking.  We had to dash back and forth between the check in desk and a ticketing desk to sort this out.

(god forbid someone bring me a chair)
I was eventually moved downstairs where we waited like cattle to board from the tarmac. It became clear that I would have to take the stairs. Keep in mind I only had the use of 1 leg, which meant jumping up the staircase one step at a time. I complained, and asked for a manager, and the middle-school level employees just glanced past me and walked away. 
I asked to be loaded first or last, so we waited more time with no instructions or apologies. Then I had to HOP up 30 steps on a slick metal staircase holding on to the railing to board the plane. It was dangerous, embarrassing and unnecessary.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,BEWARE OF SCAM AIRLINE,"This is my very first review on TripAdvisor. I have pages of stamps on my passport and have been to different places around the world, experiencing all types of things, but this was a first. I was recently on my honeymoon flying from Singapore to Hanoi. When we got to the airport, out of all the orderly lines, this airline stuck out like a sore thumb for being so disorderly. After waiting so long, we finally were checking in our bags. Long story short, they made us pay $250 for an additional small suitcase. Cash only. Basically you pay or don’t get on the flight. No mention of extra baggage fees on their website or on Expedia’s site. You just find out in the moment. Not to mention, the rudest customer service with zero willingness to help or any sense of urgency. We even looked at potentially getting another airline ticket for just our bag because it would’ve been cheaper than the scam they’re running. This happened to 12 other people/groups in line. You also have to pay for NON alcoholic beverages on the flight. Sucking every penny out of you. I would not wish this airline on my worst enemy. They should be ashamed at the type of “business” they’re running. 

Also, side note, I highly do NOT recommend Hanoi if you’re not Asian. I’m of Asian decent married to an American and the people were extremely rude and racist towards my husband. Our last night, we got shaken down by some local drivers - making us pay them all the money we had in our wallets for what should’ve been $4 ride. They took our money which ended up being around $50, which we gladly paid hoping to just return to our hotel in one piece. We were constantly getting different prices. Higher prices when my white husband ordered anything. The food is not that great. The worst service ever. Dangerous. Dirty. I was about to spend $6k just to get out of there! If you’re interested in visiting Vietnam, I’d recommend skipping Hanoi and doing south and central areas.",Date of travel: January 2019,
2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Really? Delayed, again?!","We used the airline 3 times during our trip in Vietnam and all our flights were delayed. The 1st time, I didn’t think much of it, the second time was peculiar and by the 3rd time I decided to check reviews and as you can see. There is not much more to say! On all 3 occasions, I noticed that most of the Vietjet flights were delayed and none of the other airlines 

To be fair, being in a foreign country with a foreign language can lead to some serious misunderstandings. I won’t say don’t use the airline, but take note of the following 

Make provision for at least 3 hours in flight delays. Longer if you have connecting flights!

Make sure your luggage weight is within the limits. 

Make sure about your flight times and dates. It is almost impossible to change it

Make sure that your passport details correspond to your booking details when you book a flight. If not, you will have to buy a new ticket.

There are NO refreshments included, so make sure you bring something along or have some cash with you

I also found that torture by music is very effective. You WILL listen to the same  2 songs over and over and over again!

If there is a bus transfer to the terminal, get on it. There isn’t another one coming

Other than this, the flight is fairly comfortable and the cleanliness is acceptable.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dont trust the commercial,"Evil confession, I booked vietjet because I saw the vietjet commercial of hot bikini girls dancing around. Now to that point, flying attendants are decent looking however all with RBF  and barely a smile. 

Now for people who don't care about RBF hot chicks: check in process is long and inefficient. Luggage over 7kg has to be checked in with fee,  fee needs to be paid at another counter, hand luggages will be weighted in again before the gate, fees will be collected again, before getting into the plane after bus unload you, you might get stopped again for hand luggages that appear big to them for whatever reason. 

Took Vietjet at least four times within Vietnam and it is delayed for more than an hour each time. if you have a transfer, reserve AT LEAST 3 hours in between since bus transferring, luggage pick up, and recheck in time should all be accounted for. Vietjet doesn't ship luggage to final destination and doesn't provide you one stop shop for ticket with two segments.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Never Fly Viet Jet Air,"To start out, I never write reviews on anything, but this deserves to be said to prevent the next couple from having to deal with, by far, the worst airline ever. After waiting in the check in line for approximately one hour, we were told our flight was delayed one hour. The customer service representative moved our seat to the front of the plane in an effort to expedite our connecting flight. After two hours delay we finally boarded. After we landed in Bangkok, our luggage took more than 30 minutes to get and we missed our connecting flight, no surprise there... It was one in the morning and Viet Jet didn’t open until four a.m. Once open, the customer service representative was un-knowledgeable. I was given a phone with another customer rep. and was told that we didn’t meet the criteria of “2 or 3 hours” delay in order for VietJet Air to assist in re-booking a connecting flight. The customer service woman then raised her voice, as did I. It was apparent that they were not taking any responsibility for the missed connection, even though it was their airline that caused the whole problem. I asked for a delay verification form for my travel claim, and that took 20 minutes. I was also told that I could not receive anything in writing verifying that they would not provide any connecting flight support. I also wanted this for my insurance travel claim. I was told to contact the customer support email. We were stuck in Bangkok, at 4 am, with absolutely no help from the airline that caused the issue. I was told repeatedly to send an email to the customer support email address to which I have not received any reply. We were forced to spend the night in Bangkok and get a new flight with another company the following night.

But the best part is: I wanted to cancel the flight then and book elsewhere, because it was said that we could not be transported, but the ticket was not returnable and the purchase price could not be refunded. According to the motto, I could fly, just without a wheelchair.

On arriving at the checkin we were pointed to the ticketing office after waiting in line to be told the passenger name doesn’t match the passport name and I had to purchase a new ticket. Despite arguing my point the service counter repeated its policy. I was then told to pay for extra luggage on the new ticket, despite the now forfeited ticket having the allowance. Sending my frustration the supervisor stepped in and waived the additional fee. To cap it off the flight was delayed over an hour.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Low Cost Carrier...,"Vietjet Air is another Low Cost Airline but you have to becareful as they tend to get you with the fees..

Ticket Price:
Yes it looks really cheap but its not. There are alot of surcharges and taxes that get added after you select the pricing option. The price you see is just for ticket. 

Seats:
If you tried to book a ticket you probably noticed they charge you to pre-book a seat (anywhere). Its not that expensive but still.

Also the planes are old and seat are unconfortable. After they purchased the planes (from original owner), they never remodeled the interior. My food try was broken on side and had to use my knee to keep it up straight.  

Baggage Fee:
They check your carry on bag at check-in. Even if its a bag and weight that you may have gotten away with other airlines. They check. If its over 7kg. They make you check the bag and pay the fee. Use a luggage scale at home to be sure.

If your checking in a bag. Prepay online its over 30% cheaper. At the airport they do not accept credit cards.

Food & Drink:
Even on international flights you have to pay for everything. Not even water is free. However its over priced. $2 for water. About what you would pay at the airport (some airports).

In-Flight Entertainment:
None. Get your phone, tablet, or computer preloaded with some movies or else its going to be a long flight. Unless your one that likes to sleep on planes. But remember what I said about the seats.

Overall if its really cheaper than a major airline. Then use them. Just know what your getting into. I would use Kayak or Cheapoair to shop around before you make a final choice. 

Hope this helps....

*One additional note. When there is turbulence they lock the bathroom. They won't unlock it until the captian turns off the seat belt sign.

Example:  for some strange reason they don't allow you to use headphones during take-off or landing... I don't understand why, but ok. But even with the plane on the tarmac and the doors still open they will come and insist that you remove your headphones for takeoff!  Then about 30 inutes before you are about to land they will come and insist that you remove your headphones again.  

-- Additionally they play the same song on every flight at irritation levels of volume over and over.  It takes a week after a Vietjet flight to remove it from my internal soundtrack.  
- Ground staff are often also equally officious, and just plain discourteous.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Tons of potential cost and issues,"We, a group of 7 people took a flight from Hanoi to Yangon on December 7th and went back the next Tuesday. The ticket cost 3.5M vnd ($150).

While checking in the flight from Hanoi, our checked in luggage was more heavier than the amount we bought, and we need to pay more. The staff said we had to pay 630k at another counter, or pay 400k here. When I gave her 400k, she did not receive. I didn't understand. After a while, she asked me to put money inside my passport, then I realized that she was trying to do some illegal actions. That was the biggest issue on the first flight.

During the second flight (from Yangon to Hanoi), we also had weight limit exceeded. I was ready to purchase. She said it cost $30 more. I did not have any US dollars, but she didn't accept neither Vietnamese dong nor Myanmar Kyats (note that we were checking in in Yangon International Airport). I gave her a credit card and she still declined. I had to borrow my friends, and the hell was still going on. She said I had already paid for 20kgs, and now I couldn't pay more. wth is that??? I couldn't understand her logic. What if I was travelling alone ? should I leave all my luggage to Vietjet staffs?

Some other small issues but so so annoying: Dirty dinning table, my table was almost corrupted and I was too scared of using it. Flight attendance's English was far from acceptable, I couldn't hear any words in the announcement, even though I am Vietnamese. They spoke too fast and weirdly. There were pretty small leg rooms and no free services.

With the original price of $150/person, and almost $100 extra fee, I really regret not taking a Vietnam Airlines flight instead, which was only $130.

Now mind you that, we just flew in from Detroit to Paris and to Bangkok with the same passport even being granted entry through Thai government, without any issue regarding my husband’s middle name. We requested to spoke to a manager. It took a good 15-20 mins for the manager to show up. The manager was not understanding and helpful at all. He merely told us the same thing and offered no assistance. I requested to see documentation regarding the middle name, the manager browsed through his phone for a good 10 mins and couldn’t pull it up to see me. When I finally had enough BS and decided to record the conversation, the manager refused to speak to us and sent airport securities and police to remove us.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of using,"Please NEVER ever fly with this airline! We have done 3 internal flights with vietjet air, each time they have changed the flight time at least 3 times with the only reason given as “a change to schedule”. They changed our flight time from 12.30 to 4pm but only changed it less than an hour before the flight. By that time we were already on our way to the airport. When we got there and found out, it was then too late to do anything else but sit and wait at the airport. The flight was then delayed and the gate changed but not announced, we only found out because another passenger kindly told us. The staff at the airport pretend not to speak English when there is a problem, but miraculously become fluent when trying to sell you anything. 
We paid for specific seats in advance, but when checking in for one of our flights we did not have allocated seats. I am still fighting for a refund for the money vietjet have taken from me for the service they have not provided.

It easy for you to buy later. 

Even though site says you can buy up to 3 hrs before your flight, they are referring to the premium prices 20kg for $30 USD!!!

2) Only a small carry-on of 7kg is free. 

3) If you need to buy baggage fees at check-in, you must check-in first. They weigh your bags and tell you how much to buy. They print you a ticket that you take to another counter to pay for it. Cash only. Then you get back in line to officially check-in.

4) No outside food of drink on the plane because they try to sell you everything once you’re on.

Eventually they reluctantly agreed to fill in refund forms. When no other reps were in the building, it syggests to me clearly this airline knew they screwed up but didn't have the decency to admit it, or apologise, or even act remotely responsible for the situation.

We were told that our bags were over the limit of 7kg. From our understanding we were capable of carrying 7kg each but at the gate they told us that it needed to be added together. They also weighed our carry on and added that weight to the total and said it was well over the limit. We were charged 660,000 VND. 

Everyone else (Vietnamese) who passed by was not weighed although some people were carrying 2 to 3 bags. Some people were simply spot checked by the gate person only by lifting their bags and letting them pass. We were checked on a granular level by the ounce on their 1990 rusty bathroom scale. As foreigners we felt profiled and targeted. This was unfair and I don't intend to travel with this airline ever again.

I would warn any foreigners to be very cautious when traveling with this scam airline. I would make sure all your bags are well under the weight as no one knows how reliable their old rusty bathroom scale actually is.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't.  Just don't.  Shocking.,"I have had the worst experience just now.

I've tried to get a refund because I had a nasty accident (5 broken ribs and severe pain etc).  Because I'm travelling home ASAP for medical treatment I can't use my VJ ticket.

To get a refund I was told that I must call them on the Australian phone number listed on the ticket. No matter how often I explained that my Australian SIM doesn't work here they insisted I use it.  Or buy a Viet SIM, and go through a process of registering it through a series of emails and going to their office.  Excuse me?  I'm in bed with 5 broken ribs. 

But this is just the start of their hopeless customer service. I am also required to photograph my Hospital records, pharmaceutical bills and travel back to the hospital to get a letter from a doctor saying that I can't travel on that day.  Pardon?  I'm leaving asap to get back to Australia.  Bouncing around Hanoi in a taxi to get a letter isn't going to happen. 

After asking to speak to the manager of the customer service person, I was put on hold.  For a very long time.  Then I got the same person who pretended that I hadn't asked for their manager.  

This was probably the worst customer service I've ever had in 58 years.  

Don't even think about using this airline.

ps I travel quite a lot.  Especially in SE Asia.  Although I am not a fan of Vietnam Airlines (due to inconsistent baggage policies), I will dump VJ.",,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}]"

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Beaware of the absurd baggage fees! Paid double $ for luggage than my actual ticket,"I usually don't like complaining about a business but my experience has to be shared so no one goes through their absurd fees. 

Just to give a little background. I had a flight (Nov 6th, 2018) from Yangon, Myanmar that had a layover in Hanoi, Vietnam then to Incheon, South Korea. I made the full reservation through Vietjet and no other airlines. 

I had 2 bags, one about 50lbs (suitcase) and the other about 25lbs (my backpacking backpack too big to fit in stowaway). I ended up checking in one bag in for $30 and I figured the other bag would be another $30 but NOPE! They charged $15 for every kg over 25. So they asked for $230 for my second bag but I told them I would just take it to the airplane (since I didn't have cash and they didn't take card in Yangon). Seeing how it wouldn't fit in the overhead, they took it anyways for free. Total would of been $260 but it ended up being just $30, which was nice of them. 

Fast forward to my layover in Hanoi. Turns out, I had to pay TWICE. The $30 only covered the Yangon flight to Hanoi. Now I had to pay again for my luggage to be sent from Hanoi to Incheon. This time, they weren't willing to ship the bag unless I paid so I forked over $260 (luckily they took card at the Hanoi airport). 

To wrap this up and why you should consider other airlines...

Total I paid $290 for my baggage alone. That cost doubled my actual flight which was in the range of $140. 

MIND YOU, had they took my bag for free in Yangon, I would of spent $530 on 2 bags which were both under the standard 50lb limit. My total cost for the flight would of been $670 but was $430 one way which is still absurd!

What makes the experience worse is that I looked on their website multiple times, searching keywords and even reading every letter of my booking confirmation email and I couldn't find a thing about baggage for int'l flights.... If you've made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read this. Bottomline, spend more $ for a flight that includes baggage check. If you have 1 bag you're fine but if you are traveling with 2, stay as far away from Vietjet as you can.",Date of travel: November 2018,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worse Airline Ever!!!! Scammers!!!! Beware!!!,"Right now sit here stuck in the airport in Hoi chi Minh. It all started on Nov 6th in Bangkok. I went to the airport to fly out to do a visa run. When I get to the airport and try to checkin they tell me that I am too late that the gate is closed. However It says on their own screen that gate closes 45 minutes before boarding. I’m 20 minutes head of that time it says on the screen. They tell me that that’s wrong and that broading is closed. 

I then say look at the screen I’m ahead of the time on the booking and there screen. The lady refuses to look and tells me to go to gate g19 to speak to her boss. I go to him and he says that he “Could” allow me to board because they plane hadn’t even arrived yet but that he “wasn’t” and that I would need to change flights. 

I said but I’m head of the time. He tells me go back to the ladies and they will change my flight for free. Then he gets his lunch bag and leaves. I go back to the ladies and they tell me that now they can’t book a flight for the day as they are booked and that I need to come back tomorrow with my visa letter 2 hours before the first flight that that they would give me a new flight. 

I arrive at 9am and they charge me 1450 baht extra after the guy said it would be free. Then I find out that they book me a ticket for 2pm meaning I would get today the 7th Of Nov knowing my return flight was scheduled to return at 5:35pm the same day. I tell them I was suppose to get the early 11:40 flight and they say no that only the 2pm flight was available and that there would be no issues I would be there in enough time to get my arrival visa go through customs, get back into the airport to then catch my flight.

Of course when I got there it was over hundreds of people waiting to do the same thing and many people had the same issue as I was having with Vietjet air. We waited over and hour. Then there was the long line to go through they passport check. I get out of immigration with 45 minutes to the flight. I run all the way to vietjet air and explain what has happened.

Of course I get the exact same treatment as I got in Bangkok. they told me I have now missed checkin time by a few minutes and they would no longer allow me to board. That they would need to change my flight again for $50 for the next day at 8am.

I told my girlfriend and she decided to just book me a ticket with AirAsia for 9:35pm tonight. We will NEVER EVER use vietjet air. I will gladly pay more money to use any airlines besides Vietjet Air. 

STAY AWAY from VietJet Air. They are as worthless as a $3 dollar bill. Backpackers BEWARE!!

Besides the horrible service. Whenever you go to book the ticket the prices jumps when you go to pay which all these fees.

I would not even pay a penny to them if they offered me a £1 ticket across the world 99% of the time there flights are delayed and service is rude also.

I worked for different airlines for 6 years and travelled with many different ones too this is the worst of all pay a little extra and you'll thank yourself later.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Usually delayed and poor customer service,"I've used VietJet probably around 10 times within the last couple of years, mainly because they were sometimes the only options available for domestic flights in Vietnam on certain dates and timeframe.  Almost all the flights except for 1 or 2 were delayed at least 45 minutes.  One of my biggest issue with them is for whatever reason they seem to dislike that you try to use the restroom while people are still getting on the plane.  In one example a passenger who was sitting in the front wanted to use the restroom but the flight attendants upfront told him to use the one in the back but when he went to the back the flight attendant there refused to let him and told him that since he was sitting upfront he needs to to use the one at the front.  The passenger was noticeable angry.  In another example I was one of the first to get on the plane but was sitting near the back and wanted to use the restroom but the flight attendant didn't let me saying it was because they were about to do headcount, which was ridiculous because most the passengers weren't even on the plane yet.  They didn't take headcount until 30-45 minutes later.

They're okay to take if you're not in a hurry.  Definitely don't take if you have a tight timeframe to catch another flight.  If you can, I would recommend taking Vietnam Airlines or JetStar especially if you're checking in luggage since prices usually end up being about the same with checked in bags.",Date of travel: March 2018,

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Avoid VietJet! Unless you wanna get burned!,"This is a long review of the terrible service I faced while buying tickets on vietjet website. 

On the 2nd of Oct 2018, I got onto VietJet website to purchase one ticket for 6th Oct from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh. After keying in my credit card details and hitting the submit button, the site prompted that there was an error and my card was rejected and no transaction took place.

As no transaction occurred, I proceeded to key in all my details again and after hitting the submit button, again the website told me that there was an error in processing my card and that no transaction took place.

I then decided to book with another airline since VietJet website is facing difficulties processing my booking. At this point, I got alerted via SMS from my bank stating that I have made a travel-related spend. A quick check of my bank account and true enough, there were not just one, but two charges to me for purchasing air tickets from VietJet. 

I checked my email for any notifications from VietJet but there wasn't any even after 3 hours. I then decided to call the 24/7 hotline stated on VietJet airline, 19001886. The line isn't working. No answering machine, no operator, it's not even connected. Basically, it's nonexistent. Thinking that there might be a problem with my phone or telecom provider, I got a friend in Vietnam to make the same call to the same number and the result was the same as mine. Nothing.

Faced with a phone line that isn't working and air tickets that I never receive, I decided to call my bank to stop and reverse the transaction. However, my bank operator told me that the transaction from VietJet has already gone through and that the only way out is to contact VietJet for it. 

Next is a series of emails I sent repeatedly to VietJet over the past few days and the same automated reply from VietJet that never amount to anything. These emails contains my full name, passport number, flight details.

1st email sent on 2nd Oct -> Told to wait 3-5 days
2nd email sent on 3rd Oct -> Told to wait 3-5 days
3rd email sent on 7th Oct -> Told to wait 3-5 days

This email also comes with the same nonexistent number (19001886) to call should there is an emergency or urgent need to contact VietJet. As my flight is on 6th Oct, I am indeed in urgent need to contact Vietjet and as before, the line isn't working. 

Till today 8th Oct, there is still no response from Vietjet since this incident happened 6 days ago on 2nd Oct. The line is still not working and the air ticket for my expired flight has still not been send. 

Today, I decided to contact the people of VietJet via LinkedIn as I thought maybe once I am connected to an employee of VietJet on LinkedIn, I could send a message to him/her so that they can channel me to the right person to handle this. I am still waiting. 

This incident has brought me from excited to be traveling to Vietnam to meet my girlfriend, to the anxiety of waiting for my air ticket, to the frustration of not receiving the air ticket and unresponsive customer service, to the generosity of me willing to forget about the double charges as long as you give me the air ticket as I really needed to be with my girlfriend, to the despair of both me and my girlfriend being unable to meet. 

Dear VietJet, being charged for $402 for something that I never receive is extremely upsetting.

Im writing to report to you of the very bad customer services from one of your check in staffs

Excuse Me, I went through hundred of flights before and rarely seen such grumpy face from an airlines staff treating me like Im commited some crime. Not exactly being impressed, I told him where is ""please"" in his customer services, even more shocking he replied: ""I dont need to talk nicely to you, just doing my job""

I went to the kioske to pay for the overweighted luggage and realised my concerns but the staffs in the kioske seems not care

They just reschedule flights how they feel is useful for them and they seem to be always late. I suspect they sometimes even merge two flights, if there are not too many passengers for one plane.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Inconsistent service ,"Okay so I positively reviewed VietJet for our Hanoi - Hue flight recently, but this recent experience negated any good feeling towards VietJet Air. 

We had checked in online before departing the airport and received our boarding passes, confirming seats, gate number, flight number and departure time. The departure time was 16:30. Upon arrival to the airport, the 16:30 flight to our destination had a different flight number and the 17:30 flight had the flight number that was printed on our boarding passes. Confused as to what flight we should be getting (as we’d deliberately booked the earlier flight) we went to the rep desk to enquiry further. I appreciate there was a language barrier, but all the person behind the counter let saying was “checked baggage desk 22” - we repeatedly asked and even when he and his colleague spoke between themselves we got the same response. None the wiser and exasperated with trying, we went to desk 22, checked in our luggage (a large camping rucksack each) and went for a coffee. Just as we were paying the bill, I heard my name over the tannoy, asking me to return to desk 22. When I got there and presented my documents the staff member turned to my backpack on the conveyer belt and just held up one of the shoulder straps and looked at me. It had been ripped clean off the body of the bag at the seam. I must have looked shocked or incredulous or something, because the staff member again just gestures towards the damaged luggage and shrugged. A colleague of theirs then came over and apologised, and suggested I get it plastic wrapped (I had to pay for the privilege) to make sure it wasn’t damaged further in transit. The flight was then delayed. We finally departed at around 18:00, baring in mind we were anticipating landing at around 17:40 given we booked the 16:30 flight. The flight itself was fine - seats were comfortable and the airline was clean. We were a little bit confused when they said they would dim the lights for safety reasons and then the entire cabin was plunged into darkness with all the lights off rather than dimmed but that wasn’t an issue.

At this point one of the staff gave us the WiFi code. 
We would now arrive at 1am instead of the original 10pm+.
Delays happen but be forthcoming and don’t then delay telling us about it. I even noticed that their earlier afternoon flight had been cancelled.
Once on the flight I asked for water and the air hostess told me they charged but she could get me water which came in a dirty cup and probably from the toilet sink,
I’m suprisef that after a 3 hour delay water couldn’t have been free.
Don’t even get me started on the website and how each page has an additional charge. There was a 3 dollar charge which after adding more details became 13 dollars not to mention luggage which was originally free.

I knew it was a low service airline that would charge for lots of extras, and in fact paid for a couple of them (e.g., seat assignment). However, when I got to the security line, I was surprised that they wanted to weigh my carryon and told me it was too heavy and had to be checked. It's a standard-sized carryon that I have taken with me on hundreds of flights and never been told to check it before. I was sent over to the baggage counter, where I was told everything was fine and I was sent back to the security line. (It was a busy time, so every time I moved I had to wait in a long line.) At security they again took issue with me and this time escorted me back to the baggage counter. There I tried to explain to them that this is a carryon, so they sent me to the manager's desk. He told me I would have to check it and pay the fee. So I explained I would throw some things away and then see if it was under weight and he got really mad at me, insisting that I go check the bag immediately. I went to the bathroom, threw a bunch of stuff out, put my suit coat on that had been in the bag, etc., thereby reducing the weight. Then I went back to the security line, where I asked them to re-weigh the bag, and they let me in. 10 min later (still standing in security), one of the staff approached me and asked for my boarding pass, which he took a picture of then let me continue on. I took another 20 min to get through security and find my gate, then I went and bought some lunch. As I was sitting down, the same manager walked up to me and shouted ""I have told my people not to let you on the plane with that bag. You must come back out of security, I will not let you on the plane."" I tried to talk to him, but he ignored me and walked away. So I threw out my lunch (time was now getting tight) and went back out of security. One of the staff who had been working with me saw me and she came over to help. She walked me back over to the manager's desk. I tried to explain that I was happy to pay the fee and check the bag, but it was kind of silly because the bag was now underweight and I had thrown several items in the garbage to make it happen, but he refused to talk to me. Just told her to tell me to pay the fee, which I was trying to do.

I did not expect the service either like other cheap flight, I just wanted to get over this 1 hour flight from Chiang Mai to Bangkok in peace. But this company has achieved the new level of “bad service”. 

I was in a rush to toilet since the passenger next to me was asleep the whole time I didn’t want to bother him cuz I was in middle seat. (Plus toilet sign of toilet was green and no announce said I can’t use toilet ) during preparation of landing, and literally some female attendant saw me going there. BUT less than 2mins later Male flight attendant just unlock the toilet (cuz I locked it when enter)  from outside right after 3 quick knocking without announcement or even a single word (I actually said yes and flush the toilet) . Toilet door was wildly open by him and I was seen by him like an idiot. No sorry nothing was delivered, 1 mins later the knock came back without a word either, when I came out with my frightened face, 3 flight attendant was squeezing in front of toilet staring at me like I did something wrong. 

I have sent them email but since I have seen so many complains here about this company I think I should just give up. Since I often travel and I understand different airline has different rules on this but now maybe I really should have to blame myself for not studying their policy first? and speaking of invasion of privacy, I don’t think they even understand what’s that.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Didn't have a great overall experience.,"Not great to be honest. I travelled with VietJet Air on a domestic Vietnamese service Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City. Check in was woefully slow, and I actually feared missing my flight because of it (however, there was a 30 minute delay which probably saved us!). 
Boarding was reasonable - nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Seats were basic. Not overly comfortable or spacious, but bearable for a short haul flight. I certainly wouldn't like to take their longer services! 
The cabin crew seemed rather incompetent to quieten a group of noisy, and quite frankly rude, Irish backpackers. I did not have a pleasant experience sitting behind them. I mean, how much does it take for the cabin crew to tell them to be quieter and respect the other passengers on board? 
Food is available to purchase at reasonable prices. I mean, the food is ok, but nothing special.
Arrival in HCMC was haphazard to say the least. Passengers were even walking under the wing of the aircraft. I have NEVER seen that happen at any other airport in the world. And I have been to a rat number of airports. 
Someone (airline or airport) seemed to have undercounted the number of passengers and left a group of around 6 (including me) ""stranded"" for approximately 10 minutes on the tarmac waiting for a bus to the terminal. 
Overall experience - poor, and i probably would fly with Vietnam's flag carrier if I fly domestic in Viet Nam in the future.",Date of travel: July 2018,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

I am a Romanian citizen and I had planned a trip from Dubai to Vietnam and in between I decided to use Vietjetair to go from Hanoi to Siem Reap and it was one of the worst decisions I made. After I researched on the government website it appears that any citizen of anywhere can transit into Hanoi Airport provided they leave the country in 24h, however this is not valid if you are traveling with Vietjetair apparently. After the crew was extremely rude and unprofessional leaving me stranded and not giving me any explanation about why I was not allowed on the flight from Siem Reap to Hanoi back and allow to transit from Hanoi to Dubai with Emirates I was finally informed by the manager who was extremely rude also that I would not be allowed unless I have an urgency visa which costs USD 200 even though I will not leave the airport transit area and I already checked in with Emirates and I did not have luggage to check in. 

I paid this amount at their request only to find out in Hanoi that Emirates will print my boarding pass and send someone to provide it to me in the transit area and I would not need a visa at all since I am not leaving the airport. I had to pay for USD 200 just to be allowed on Vietjetair flight and I did not even need the visa. I was traveling with a friend who is a british citizen and already used his visa on arrivals a few days before and he didn’t have any issues not boarding on the flight. although their rules should be universal for everyone. What is more the Vietnam immigration website says that as a british citizen you can use your visa on arrival option just once every month, so following the legislation he couldn’t even have entered the country but he didn’t have any issues because he was british. That is pure discrimination. 

On top of that the flight happened in the middle of thunderstorms and I almost thought that I will not even make it.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mr. Elson,"Vietjet is a terrible flight and have very poor management.

I flew Scoot from Singapore to meet my vietnam friends who flew from Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam to Bangkok. I took a earlier flight and arrived at 16.45hrs BKK time. They are suppose to arrive BKK at 18.45hrs and I plan to wait them for 2 hrs.

Unfortunately, VJ as usual was delayed for 8 hours due to technical issue of plane. I waited for 10 hours at BKK airport.:(

One of my friend received a broken luggage upon arrival, it delayed our time even more, the new luggage cost over USD80 and they only agree a compensation of 500baht.

When we leave BKK, we took a flight by VJ to HCMC. The lady ask for return ticket and threw back my passport to me, as I have not decide how many days to stay in Vietnam, I do have not book any. They forced me to book any flight which i have no intention to take as my date of return was not fixed.

To no choice i booked a return flight to Singapore a week later. When i arrived at HCMC, the immigration officer ask me how long i will stay and i told her about a week, she stamp a one month stay validity and I hate Vietjet for making all the nonsense inconvenient to passenger.

They should review their policy and improve on the staff attitude and way of operation. NO MORE VIETJET AGAIN.",Date of travel: August 2018,

Legroom is very limited, so it was very cramped, however in my opinion fine for a relatively short flight. For any longer, however, I would definitely recommend paying extra for an all-inclusive airline.

I did not order extra baggage allowance at the time of buying my ticket, however it was simple to do this over the phone, paying at the airport. It's worth noting, though, that they only accept cash, and ask for USD. 

The staff on-board were nice enough.

Overall, it was an uncomfortable flight, but the service was decent.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst airline compagny ever!,"We don't mind to fly in low cost we know that there is less service but how Vietjet treats their customers is realy a shame! We booked a flight at 13h50, 2 days before departure. The night before departure we received a mail that the flight is resceduled to 14h50. At 7h30 in the morning we received another mail that the flight was resceduled again to 16h. So we called Vietjet to check which time was our flight because this was very confusing. They confirmed that the  departure time was at 16h. The reason for this was because the airport traffic was to busy, so they had to rescedule the flights for security reasons. Ok, we were a little upset because we lost 2 hours but that was not the end of the world and the reason was acceptable (btw, this was a lie we found out later). So we took our taxi later and arrived at the airport at 14h30. We checked the departure hours and we saw that our flight was not listed... so we went to the desk of vietjet to check why and then we were told that the flight was AGAIN (for the 3th time) resceduled to 17h30. Was this a joke? If we asked the reason. They only could tell us it was due to the bad weather but we could get a refund and book with another (expensiver) compagny who could leave at 16h... ok so for the other compagny it was not bad weather? Sudenly we could maybe go with a flight at 16h45 if other passengers won't show up. So we waited and at 16h we went back to the desk and were told that the flight of 16h45 had delay to 17h30 and we just had to take the flight of 17h40. What a mess! So to end the story we finally left at 18h! 4 hours later than planned and the reason for this is because they sell flights and if the airplanes are not full enough they just move passengers to other flights without thinking that passengers maybe have a connecting flight or booked trips and loses a lot of money! We also asked if we could get a refund for our pick up we booked at ho chi minh and the foodtour we missed. They told us refunds only starts from 4h delay and because the departure time was at 17h40 so our delay was only 3h50min (but we actually left at 18h) we couldn't get a refund. This is ridiculous! This is not how you treat customers! Like i said... worst compagnie ever. This was the first and the last time we booked with vietjet! i prefer to pay 50$ or 100$ more with a compagnie who cares about their customers and their reputation. And i'm realy sorry for the people who works at the airportdesk because they are the ones who has to clean all the mess the compagny makes. So if i have to rate the staff. I give them a 4 for staying calm and friendly to angry passengers. This is not a fun job.

However, this morning I encountered the nasty Vietjet checkin crew in Singapore airport. I was willing to accept the fact that they wish to enforce their strict carry-on limit. However, the exact same carry-on that I took with me last week with VietJet out of Saigon, and that was accepted on 3 previous flights, was no longer accepted this morning.  So that is strike one against consistency within the airline. 
Then there was the absolute refusal to budge or discuss -- Strike 2.  Then they charged me for 20 Kg of checked baggage, which I didn't need, even though I know that VietJet has a 15 Kg minimum class for checked baggage, because I've used it in the past -- Strike 3.  
Then they refused to allow me to pay by credit card, so I had to run off to find a currency exchange to purchase the $40 (Singapore dollars) to pay them in cash -- Strike 4.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Vietjet bumped me off due to overbooking without any compensation ...and on top of that the usual delay.,"Arrived at check-in counter in Bangkok 1 hour 30 minutes before flight vj804 scheduled departure (1.50 pm). They said flight is full due to overbooking. Next flight, 6 hours later, at 7.55 pm, also full so they gave 2 options :
1) waiting list on 7.55 pm flight (no guarantee of having a place)
2) Refund of the ticket price
They also gave no guarantee on flights of the next day. 
And in any case no financial compensation, not even in case of no place available on the next flight.
I chose for waiting list on the next flight (no other decent flight option available).They provided lounge (the cheapest CIP lounge at BKK airport) during waiting time and after another hour waiting at the counter I finally got my boarding card for the 7.55 flight.
Right now I am writing from gate, it's 8.05 and boarding not yet started (they say 20 minutes delay but obviously will be more).
Conclusions :
I took vietjet flights several times. Most of the times flights have considerable delay.
I am aware of overbooking practices of airlines, but cannot accept they simply can bump you off without any compensation. Compensation is regulated by laws in Europe and USA. Any chance to get compensation in the rest of the world? and especially in this case in South East Asia? 
This fact of my precious time being stolen without any consequence for the airline is unacceptable in my opinion.
Not sure the policy of other regional airlines is different or not, but I find Vietjet one unacceptable.
In any case,  if you can avoid flying Vietjet, do it! The usual delay of the flights is already a good reason!",Date of travel: July 2018,

I noticed when I arrived at the airport that my name ""first name/middle name/last name"", appeared instead as ""middle name/last name/last name"". 

When I was redirected to their counter to discuss the issue I was told I would be unable to board as a result of my name not matching what showed on the passport. I asked about changing the name as my email on my reservation displayed my full name, and asked if they could clarify via the passport number that I had submitted on my booking, but was told that I was required to make name changes up til 3 hrs til the flight. When I tried to explain my situation and come up with a solution, the check in agents seemed to fake a sudden inability to communicate in English that hadn't been an issue for any of my friends who had checked in previously.

As the flight was coming up in the hour, they then sold me another ticket at double the cost of the original and I was required to go back in line to check my baggage.

One of my friends had the misfortune of violating their arbitrary weight max for carry ons and was given a fee equivalent to 60% of his original ticket.

Another girl we spoke to earlier in the week had a flight scheduled to leave at 2AM. She had the fortune of having her 1hr flight rescheduled to 4AM about 15hr before the flight. Yay Vietjet! I guess you really do get what you pay for.

Terrible customer service, predatory practices, and overall one of the worst experiences that I've had with an airline.

However, the flight attendant’s service were so bad, I’d hesistate before booking another flight with VietJet. 
From my personal experience, a flight attendant shouted at me to move into the seats when I was trying to put my hand carry bag in the overhead compartment. This may be because they were already running late on schedule and they were trying to rush the crowd. However, it wasn’t like I was taking my time with putting my bags, but because the passage way is very cramped, the other passengers behind me were unable to go through, which I thought was common for most Budget flights. Hence, I felt that it wasn’t unnecessary for the flight attendant to shout and look angry at this.
Furthermore when I went to use the toilet midway through the flight, the flight attendants were all sitting at the back of the plane and talking really loudly. I could even hear them from my sitting area near the middle. Not only gossiping, they were also taking about how much they hate their job and were only doing it cos they “don’t have a choice”.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Hell is just a never ending VietJet flight,"I had the extreme unfortune of flying VietJet Air multiple times on my trip to Southeast Asia. I have seen what hell is like, and it is a never-ending VietJet flight.

Right from the start, the way the plane was boarded indicated the chaotic nature VietJet seems to prefer. Even free-for-all airlines like EasyJet have more orderly boarding lines. Once aboard, the airline plays this “I believe in angels” pop song on repeat on every flight of theirs. That song will haunt my nightmares. 

I don’t know if they give priority or discounts to families with screaming children, but I have never had the bad luck of sitting near not 1 or 2 - but 6 loud kicking and running babies on one flight (and only 4 on my next VietJet flight). The crew has either been told not to care, or is not being paid enough to care, about the orderliness of their customers. One passenger near me was having a cell phone conversation mid-flight. A child was running the aisle, while two ladies patrolled with screaming babies to ensure it was not only those as unlikely as I who got to hear it. We were all part of the spectacle. 

Also it is worth nothing that my legs were up against the seat in front of mine, which made each kick of the child behind me on the first flight (and each seat-grab of a parent standing up on the second) all the more uncomfortable. I’m less than 6 feet by the way, the seats are just really really close together. 

When we landed, people pushed to the front before the doors even opened. The first VietJet flight this happened on I thought, maybe that passenger had somewhere to go. But then it happened my next VietJet flight as well - and I saw the passenger who was pushing just standing on the jetway. 

I would like to say for the record I have flown all over the world and across Southeast Asia. I have never once seen the kind of unruly conditions I experienced on my multiple VietJet flights. Not on Asiana, or Busan Air, or Cathay Pacific, or Thai Air, or Vietnam Air (which was a great experience), only on VietJet.

I think my flights with this airline literally raised my blood pressure and may have taken time off of my life. Thank you.",Date of travel: June 2018,

The staff is lovely, and the tickets are cheap so it is worth the discomfort for one hour or so!

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Inconsiderate VietJet Employees at Phnom Penh International Airport,"I was travelling from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City earlier this year and had an awful experience with VietJet employees at PPIA. Because of really awful traffic, I made it to the airport with only 50 minutes before my flight. For reference, I made a flight to Seoul on Korean Air with only 25 minutes left before the flight departed several years ago, but I do not make a habit of showing up late to the airport. I arrived at the airport and, not seeing any agents in the main ticketing area, I asked the person at the information desk to call the airline for me, which she did. At this point, I had a full 45 minutes to check in, get through security and board the plane, which most of the time is more than enough time at PPIA. However, the VietJet employee I spoke to refused to come help me check in and said it was ""against our policy"" to do so. I explained to him that the traffic had been awful and that all I needed was for him to come and check me in, so I could go through security and board my plane. He continued to refuse and eventually hung up on me. I have never received such poor service from an airline and will never fly VietJet again.",Date of travel: February 2018,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}]"

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Two domestic flights on ancient planes,"I flew Vietjet domestic twice, from Can Tho to DaNang as well as from Hue to Hanoi. It was more like 2.5 stars. Actually, I'm trying to think of why I would give it any stars; I suppose because it was on time, and because it did get us from point A to point B. Beyond that, both were the oldest planes I have ever been on, making a lot of noise like a propellor plane rather than a jet, and flown by absolute daredevils, pitching, yawing, and generally making the ride unpleasant without being turbulent. Additionally, the seats were ripped so that the stuffing was falling out from the leather, and the seat belt was ancient. The window was scuffed badly enough that I could barely see outside. It was a fossil of a plane, and in each one hour flight, I managed to get quite airsick. 

Service on-board seemed weary. 

Check-in was comically disorganized.

Additionally, the VietJet lounge served no liquor other than beer (at least in Can Tho; I did not check it in DaNang) and a minimalist amount of food, and likewise, on board, only beer and a few snacks were available. 

The seatbelt rules for children were in no way enforced, so I found myself being assailed for an hour in a bumpy, dive-bombing plane by several children, all of whom were noisy, many of whom were standing on their seats, turned round, poking at me. While in 90% of all situations, I would find this cute, as a relatively anxious flier, at that time, I did not. 

There was no in-flight entertainment. There wasn't even a magazine to read.

And the price that we paid was $60+ per ticket. I don't know why other tickets showed as far less, but that's what we paid, in advance, on their website. It's still very cheap of course. 

I considered taking the train from Hue to Hanoi since at least then I might see some countryside, but in the end, I took the plane again. There is nothing to recommend except it gets you from point A to point B without having to take the train (although from Hue to Hanoi, I think I would just do that the next time). And it was, again, on time for the two flights that I took, which was appreciated.",Date of travel: May 2018,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Vietnamese version of jet2!,"It wasn't the worst but definitely was not great...
On the surface it looked like it would be the cheapest flight option however they hit you with hidden baggage costs and numerous taxes (never seen so many listed in my life!)
There was no meal (not a problem but when you compare to vietnam airlines who include a meal, baggage allowance and have no hidden costs for roughly the same amount thought it was worth mentioning).
We had extra legroom seats by the emergency exits but the seats were so uncomfortable, far too small and tight!
Staff were friendly and our baggage came through quickly so can't complain really but overall just an average flight.
If I had no other option I might use them again but if there is an option to fly with them or someome like vietnam airlines it would be vietnam airlines everyday!

All passagers were hot and stuffy in the aircraft on their seats. The one and only announcement said that it is going to take 5 minutes. However, It took almost 1 hour. I was perspiring profusely in the aircraft with so many others. It was hard to breathe as well. After the first announcement, no other announcements were made and all of us were waiting for something to happen and none of us knew when the plane would fly. After 1 and a half hours of flight delay, they finally set off without an apology or water or anything. Such bad service.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awful, incompetent staff","Terrible, unorganised airline. Their staff gave us misleading and incorrect information about our connecting flight and what would happen to our luggage. They informed us three times that they would place our checked luggage on to our connecting flight. Fortunately, we had a bad feeling about it and therefore waited at baggage reclaim regardless (where we later found our bag). They gave us one boarding pass, despite us having two flights in short succession, which led to us having to sprint through the airport to try and recheck in for the connecting flight. We had 15 minutes to do this, due to our first flight being delayed. The connecting flight was then delayed by a further two hours. An awful, stressful experience where their staff seemed unsure of the most basic processes involved with flying. Sure, they are cheap but we would always fly with their competitors after this experience. They lacked the knowledge necessary to run a successful airline and worst still, seemed oblivious and unwilling to apologise for their mistakes. If you fly with them, be sure to keep tabs on your luggage (because they won't).",Date of travel: May 2018,
2.0 of 5 bubbles,Awful Airline - always delayed and no customer information,"We flew with Vietjet airways 3 times in the space of 8 days (Hanoi - Da Nang, Da Nang - Ho Chi Minh and Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi). Considering these were just short domestic flights I was astonished that every flight we took was delayed by a minum of 1 hour 30 mins. On one occasion (SGN - HAN) we arrived at the departure gate as indicated by the airport schedule screen and found just a white board outside the gate indicating the flight had been delayed by 1 hour 40 mins. There were no staff there to offer an information concerning the delay.

Furthermore on every occasion when checking in luggage and boarding the flights there was no coordination (i.e allowing certain rows of the plane board first) just a complete free for all with people pushing and shoving to board the flight. I don’t know whether this is the Vietnamese culture and they are unaware civilised queuing etiquette but it wasn’t pleasant and just prolonged the awful boarding experience.

If travelling to Vietnam and are looking to use domestic flights to get between cities I would not recommend using Vietjet, it’s not a pleasant experience and you need to equate an extra 2 hours into your journey as your flight WILL be delayed!",Date of travel: June 2018,
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Flew twice with them....no problems,"We flew Vietjet Air (domestic) twice in a week during our trip to Vietnam in May. Going by the other reviews here, I was dreading my decision to book with them & not the much more expensive Vietnam Airlines. However I was quiet surprised that the service was not as bad. Even though both our flights were delayed by an hour, everything from check-in to boarding to baggage was hassle-free & uneventful. I would fly them again as I felt I got the full value for what I paid for my tickets. However please note that the legroom between rows is remarkably cramped. I do not know if their international flight seat arrangement is as tight but both our domestic flights, was. Cleanliness is also an issue with traces of food crumbs & wrappers still very much present on & around the seats. Air sickness bags need to be placed by default in all seat pockets but strangely only one seat pocket in our entire row (both flights) had one while the attendant walked around with a few in hand asking if anyone needed one for themselves. Their online booking portal also needs some attention as repeated credit card transaction denials are really annoying & makes one really lose it. I booked mine after multiple tries using different cards till one magically worked!

Tip: It may prove useful to keep enough time buffers for important onward tours or tasks planned after taking a Vietjet Air flight. This is to factor for delays (which I am told are very common for this airline). If possible look up FlightRadar24 to check the punctuality history of your flight number & minimize the chances of ruining your onward plans.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Cheap domestic flights out of BKK,"Wanted to get from BKK to Chiang Mai as we were flying international into bkk. Problem was, we thought, flights were either expensive (thai airways) or alternatively fly out on Air Asia or other discounted airlines flying out of DMK. But that would mean wasting 3 or 4 hours to save maybe $100. 

Luckily, we found VietJet airways and booked despite what seemed like questionable reviews

It is true you pay for everything except 7kg of cabin baggage. But it was very inexpensive to purchase checked bags, $4 for 15 kg. 

The checkin gates were fast and efficient. Our flight out of BKK and also CNX were on time 

The plane was no more crowded or dirty than our Air China flights from Canada   Se vice was efficient

Their schedules mean absolutely nothing.  You're going to fly when THEY decide you should fly.  So if you need to be somewhere at a certain time, choose another airline.  On this particular flight, I arrived at the airport about three hours before my flight, only to find that my flight was delayed.  I asked if I could be put on an earlier flight, but they told me that they could only change my flight for free if the delay was more than an hour, and in this case my delay was only for 30 minutes.  Shortly after I checked in, though, my delay was extended - to over an hour -  but it was too late for me to change my flight, as I had already checked in and my bag was already headed for loading on my original flight.  So basically, this airline has ZERO respect for its schedules.  The only reason people fly with them is because they are cheap.

It is the second time I fly with them and both time the same issue occurred.
Although being a very fine low cost airline, with clean airplane, on time flight, great uniforms, smiling crew, some training is needed amongst the cabin crew.

The second flight I asked again the steward who did not know what I was talking about and went to enquire with the Chief Purser, then they start to give the paper away to passengers 15 minutes before landing. This is a serious issue for passengers as those papers are needed on arrival to Cambodia and not having them on hand when arriving to the terminal, delays tremendously the all process and make the passengers upset and unhappy.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,"A scary, unprecedented warning from the captain, facing us","I flew from Saigon to Bangkok on May 13th. Shortly after most people had boarded, the anxious captain from Mexico came out of the cabin and faced the passengers, warning us that we must turn our phones off immediately and keep them off. Of course I'm familiar with the request that phones be turned off once the plane is moving. And I always turn mine off before the plane starts moving on the tarmac. But this was the first time in my almost 40 years of flying that I've seen a captain come out and speak to the passengers. What he said was not so clear, due to his rather heavy accent, but the gist of it was: ""You MUST turn off your phones now!!! And keep them off. Some gas enters the cabin when we are refueling and ..., and the ____ emitted by the phones can cause an explosion! Turn them off now!"" He had a very grave, scary look. I'm sure he had our best interests in mind, but, if what he said is correct, that essential fact should be explained very clearly in something that is printed and handed out to all passengers on all flights. And he should have had the crew translate his message in Vietnamese and Thai. Several people simply ignored him. As I say, his English wasn't so clear, but the message was most stressful before the flight. Another point is that, as with most VietJet flights I've been on, the flight attendants tend to be rather gruff and even rude, though they may not intend to be. The manner of speaking of most of them is not gentle or polite. Their requests come off as orders.",Date of travel: May 2018,

So I stuffed as much in my hand luggage as possible and ended up with a smaller bill. Many people had there cloths in a plastic bag along with there hand luggage to save weight

My seat was a simple standard one, not particularly comfortable but easily acceptable enough for a short flight.
This is a no frills airline, so if you want a meal you have to pay for it. The meal we had was pretty bland stuff and I left most of it. We'd only ordered a meal because it was a lunchtime flight. With hindsight, I'd give it a miss next time.
Staff were very friendly, did the usual safety drill display and bustled about making sure seatbelts were used, luggage compartments were closed etc etc.
There was no in-flight entertainment but it wasn't needed for such a short flight. Toilets were simple and clean.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst Flight Of My Life,"Worst Flight of My Life 

I recently booked a return Bkk Chinagmai ticket with this Thai Vietjet . Check in at Bangkok no problem, asked for exit row, got it. 30 minute delay otherwise uneventful flight. Check in at Chiangmai a few days later, again no problem, asked for exit row got it. Now I'm over 6 foot tall and I either travel business class on long haul or book an exit row if travelling short hops. Usually there is an extra charge for this which I am always  happy to pay. Thaiviet allocated this seating at check in with no extra cost so kudos to them. Got on flight took my seat. All well until one of the hostesses came up to me and in an officious voice loudly asked me how old I was. I told her this was none of her business and asked her why she wanted to know. She said there is an age restriction on who sits in the exit rows because of what might happen in an emergency. Now as I said I am over 6 foot 68 year old tall ,in good phsical condition exercise daily not overweight and certainly as capable if not more capable as anybody else who were seated in exit rows would be if something happened. I explained I needed the extra leg room and she said thats ok we will give you a seat with more room. So I followed her to the front of the plane and she pointed to a standard seat with restricted leg room and told me to sit there. She had lied to me . There were empty seats on the first row with more leg room and I asked to sit there. She refused . I should have gone back to my exit row seat but the embarressment was by now so great that I just decided to accept my humiliating situation and promise myself i would never fly this airline again.  Not over yet. Arrived in Bangkok collected my luggage and found my case had been badly damaged and could never be used again. This is an expensive suitacse that I've had for about 2 years costing $300 . Contacted airport information who were very helpful and called the airport office of the airline. She was told somebiody would be with me in 10 minutes. I waited an hour before somebody finally showed up who looked like she was obviously not having a good day. I showed her the bag , she took photos and offered me compensation of $7. I told her she must be joking and off she went to check with her manager. Came back 15 minutes later and offered $15.  Again I refused and she said she would make further enquiries and let me know. That was 6 weeks ago with no contact from them.  The vast majority of flights on all airlines are uneventful , it is only when things go wrong that you know what an airline stands for. Thai Vietjet I believe do not care one little bit for their passengers",Date of travel: April 2018,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}]"

When the guy at the check in gave us our boarding pass, he did mentioned a word that the flight was delate or that the flight schedule had changed. We were supposed to depart at 12.50, But now boarding was at 13.00. Boarding also went smooth. We were taken to the aircraft by a bus. Push back was at 13.30 and we took off at 13.48. Flying time was 1hr and 50 min.

There was an inflight magazine but most of it was in Vietnamese. No Inflight entertainment nor meals. The flight attendants came by with snacks and beverages. Which you could buy. You can pre order meals.  when booking the flight. I ordered two fried rice with pork and two bottles of water. For my friend an i. It was very greasy, but edible. I cant say great and i will not recommend it to some one else. I could know. The seat width and leg space were ok (for me). I am not that big and tall. The seat were simply upholstered, but without head support.

We landed at 15.16 instead of 14.40. Agian we were taken to the arrival hall by a bus. When we arrived the Luggage was already on the carousel.

This smooth flight was not fully booked. The flight attendants were friendly, nice and helpful. The toilets are kept clean.  Keep in mind that you may  only  have 10 kilos of cabin bagage and for hold baggage you have to pay. Its better to pay it in advance when making the booking.

Then I booked the return flight with my Chinese name in passport correctly.

So when I tried to check in, Vietjet didn't allow me. They said the booking name has to be same as passport name.

When I spoke to the manager, they said they can't refund any of my tickets (departure and return). And they cannot change my booking name on the spot, even though I still have sufficient time to board the flight.

They could have tried to change my name on the system on the spot or at least issue a refund for my return ticket in credit.

No problem so far. When we arrived at the airport, I has misjudged the weight and we were 8kg over. I am thinking no problem they will charge me 10 or 15 baht per kg extra. Well not exactly, They charged me 400 baht for the 8kg, so 5 times as much as buying it online with the ticket.

And its safe to say what a huge huge disappointment. And such an unpleasant experience. On our first flight from Bangkok - Phuket. The plane was delayed over 2 hours. With no explanation at all, And after what was already a very long flight from the UK this caused much upset. Especially to the people with young restless Children, never mind me and my partner. 

We finally made it to boarding and was then greeted by a shuttle bus. This then added even more time because firstly staff were escorted onto the plane with us/passengers following on two separate busses.

After a short flight we landed in Phuket. And was the suddenly greeted with
 ''everyone please remain calm we are having trouble with the aircraft's exit door'.

The Plane then went pitch black, with everyone anxious and nervous whilst you could hear the electrics trying to work in opening the door. In this heat with no cold air supply we began to feel sick and agitated.

On the Return flight again we experienced a delay of 45 minutes. With no explanation again until my parter had enough and went and asked the staff where she was greeted by one lady of which didnt understand. And a gentleman who seemed very arrogant.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Value Carrier Redefined,"I chose Vietjet Air as it was the only option due to  a last-minute meeting in HKG. Where to start? They have a solid track record of late departures.  To save gate fees, at least on this flight,they shuttled passengers via bus (through an active tarmac). It's in your best interest to be at the front of that line to get on the bus, otherwise you'll have to wait for the second bus to get you to the plane and you'll probably miss out on overhead bins storage. Some passengers had to hold their carry-ins in their lap. Apparently, if you want food on this airline, you order ahead and have to show your boarding pass to prove you are the recipient. Oh, and make sure you bring Vietnamese Dong or USD, or you won't be able to acquire any type of drink or light snack on the flight. In another well thought out marketing scheme, Vietjet has sold all overhead bin fascia and turned it into a billboard for a Viet brand of water named ""Sweaty"". You can't make these things up. (See attached photos for reference). One very important piece of advice is to bring noise-cancelling headphones, as the the patrons tend to talk loud during the entire flight. The highlight of the flight was when the cabin crew announced that Hong Kong International Airport requires ALL inbound Internationsl flights to be fumigated and that the Fumigant was approved to be safe by the World Health Organization (WHO). This was a blatant LIE, as I flew in from the US to HKG 3 days prior and no such announcement was made NOR was any Fumigant sprayed on passengers on Final descent. 
I couldn't believe my eyes....the flight attendants were walking up and down the aisleway SPRAYING some noxious chemicals in the air until the ENTIRE cabin was cloudy with God knows what carcinogenic FUMIGANT! It actually made me nautious about 45 minutes later, a long with a splitting headache! Please see pictures for reference. NEEDLESS TO SAY, VIETJET AIR WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SPRAYING ME ON FUTURE FLIGHTS.

What customer service did NOT saw was that you MUCH buy the baggage fee online! When we went to check in, we were informed the fee was 458Bhat!!! WTF??? So we tried to call customer service and they do not open until 0800 but we had to check in before 0700!!! So we tried the BS website and it would not let us purchase the baggage fee so we were screwed into paying 458Bhat for 12KG!!! Next, the service people were all rude and did not give a crap! On the plane, could not even get a cup of water unless you wanted to pay 120Bhat!! Seats sucked, Flight attendants were useless! They tried to charge you for everything except the air on the plane and hell, it was already too thin! Avoid this f-ing airline! It sucks!! I will NEVER use it again! I will NEVER use trip.com again!

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Got No Less than I paid for,"The family had an early morning flight out of ICN that was delayed an hour and half because of delay of the incoming flight.  Not the first time and wont be last.  It happens.  You will most likely have to shuttle from the gate to the plane.  Boarding was painless, plenty of room to store bags in the over head.  You will need to use it because there is not much under the seat.  Leg room seemed a little tight but expected on a value airline.
Make sure you pay attention to luggage allowances so you don't cut yourself short.  If you buy the ticket from the Airline website they will autoselect 20KG for checkin.  That means a single check-in weighing less than 20 KG.  In addition you can carry on normal carryon size bag under 7KG.  We also carried on a laptop bag with no problems.  YMMV.
EVERYTHING but AIR is extra so if you want water pre-order, bring it on or suck it up.  You will pay less by ordering for the flight than buying in the Airport for sure.  Upgrade to larger seats in front may be available when you order.  Cost is ridiculously low and worth it.

Crew was very professional, courteous and efficient.  A few are at least tri-lingual.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,3 Great Flights,The youthful exuberance of the flight crew delivered a memorable experience. Two of my three flights were changed by the Airline after booking however the communication was good and notification via email from VietJet was more than 24 hours prior to departure in both cases the flights departed within 4 hours of my original booking. I am 5ft 10 and my nephew pushing 6ft had no problem with legroom in fact it is more generous than both Tigerair Australia and Jetstar domestic Australia. The onboard meals were well priced and value for money and the aforementioned flight crews on all 3 flights were excellent with a high level of English. In fact I have to say VietJet gives great bang for buck compared to the so called full service Vietnam Airlines (we had 2 internal flights) on routes not serviced by VietJet and the Vietnam Airlines Service was below average given the high ticket price. In fact when I was booking flights from Saigon to Hanoi VietJet was $79USD including luggage verses $190USD on Vietnam Airlines. Even with the the change in flight which left 1.5hours later than my original booking.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bought in advance (w/bags), Easy check-in, Pleasant experience","After reading some bad reviews I was a bit nervous about flying this discount airline but we had a positive experience. It's all about expectations!!! If you've flown a RyanAir, EasyJet, Spirit Airlines, Frontier, etc you should know that there are extra fees for everything from bags to beverages. If you're simply trying to get from Point A to Point B in the most cost efficient manner, it's hard to be upset about not getting a free can of Sprite included in your $35 round trip ticket.

The line to check in was very quick (20 min max) and the reps at the counter were friendly. My bag was a bit over my 15kg pre-purchased weight and she did not seem to mind. I knew I would have to purchase more weight for the return flight so she directed me to the service counter. Adding 5kg was shockingly only 45 baht (about $1.50 USD).

The boarding process is actually smarter than most airlines where (aside from premier members) they board starting with the back of the plane. Yes, sounds obvious, but a lot of airlines have yet to figure out the efficiency of this method. We were in the front of the plane so we boarded last and there was plenty of overhead space. We noticed the first 5 rows were empty and, without us even asking, the flight attendant suggested we move up to have our own row after take off--which was very sweet.

My husband bought the tickets, using his bank card, his email and his phone number from Finland. They demanded that they can change, if we pay 32 usd/one way/ticket. so that meant we had to pay 32*4= 128 usd. We agreed. then they said,  we need to show them a copy of my parents in law passports. We argued that that it is not necessary since we have payment evidence. Then they said my husband needs to use his phone number to call the Operator. The reason is that they need to identify my husband's phone number. We tried and nobody answer. Then we suggested that ok, can we call the the girl at the customer service phone, so that she and her manager can identify my husband phone number. They rejected the request with no other reason that the ""policy"". Then I asked, ok show us the written Policy in document, they did not have it.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disability Discrimination by Vietjet Airlines,"Really really disappointed.  

While checking in for my flight from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City on the 28th of December 2017 I encountered outright contempt for both myself and my medical condition from Miss Siti, Vietjet Senior Associate.  

I was nearly killed in automobile accident in August 2009 and consequently I injured my lower back, right knee and most importantly severely aggravated a C4/C5 spinal compression I had sustained 16 years prior.  After a successful arthroscopic knee surgery and 5 hard years of countless hours in rehab (2-4 times per week) everything, aside from the spinal compression, has healed for the most part.  Unfortunately I'll be dealing with the spinal compression for the rest of my life.  I still need chiropractic adjustments every few months to keep it in check; but aside from that I just need to refrain from standing for more than 5 minutes at a time as doing so leads to severe pain that can only be alleviated with immediate chiropractic adjustments and physical therapy.

My doctor has provided me with a simple letter that verifies that I'm unable to stand for prolonged periods of time, requests cooperation in this regard accordingly and encourages any questions about my condition to be addressed immediately to her.

I attempted to present this letter to Miss Siti when I checked in for my flight, VJ814 Singapore to HCMC, at Changi airport terminal 3 at approximately 15:00 on 28-12-17 as I had utilized the express line for passengers with medical conditions as I'm entitled to, but she didn't bother to read it.  She complained about my carry on luggage being overweight so I offered to take out and wear some clothes to remedy this.  I also offered to pay for the excess if absolutely necessary but hoped she could be a little more understanding and just overlook a few extra t-shirts.  Everything up to this point was of course perfectly acceptable.  What she she did next was certainly not.

She said that if I really had a medical condition I wouldn't have packed such a heavy bag, thereby bringing my integrity into question and belittling all the pain and suffering I've endured.  I pointed out that my bag was just a small carry on, had wheels, wasn't particularly heavy and that moderate lifting doesn't bother me in any case.  As the letter from my doctor clearly states it's just standing for prolonged periods that causes me pain.  She remained unconvinced.  I then asked her if she was a doctor and was somehow qualified to make such a medical assessment after having just met me a moment earlier.  A medical assessment that directly contradicts the six doctors, two physical therapists and two osteopaths who actually treated me for years.  She said that her father was a doctor and that it was company policy for her to make such assessments.

Having already stood there for a few minutes being insulted and already resolving the overweight carry on issue, I decided to take a seat, rest for a few minutes and gather myself.  I then approached her and asked for her full name and employee reference number which she refused to give.  She demanded to know why I wanted such information so I told her that I would be filing a complaint with Vietjet and tried to explain why, with the purpose being that perhaps she might think about how she treated me.  Maybe a lesson could be learned from this and in future she might show others the compassion and respect everyone deserves.  It was pointless, she continually interrupted me, refuting everything I had to say before I even finished saying it in much the same way she refuted my medical certificate from the start.

I had hoped that contrary to Miss Siti's claims, Vietjet does not condone her ignorant, disrespectful behaviour and that she would be reprimanded accordingly for such discrimination. Unfortunately all Vietjet had to offer was empty apologies thereby condoning and even encouraging all this.

So very disappointing.",Date of travel: December 2017,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}]"

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrendous experience. Don't fly with this company,"Myself and family, 4 in total, were finishing our 2 week holiday having travelled to Hong Kong and then onto Vietnam finishing with the last week in Phu Quoc. 
On the morning of our departure we arrived at the airport very early. We were told to check in at 10.30 am and to ask for a specific man so that our luggage could be put through to go all the way to Hong Kong without us having to collect it at ho chi minh. We had 2 other connecting flights to get after our initial flight from Phu Quoc. We had allowed ample time to get our other connecting flights. We were going from Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh, Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong,  Hong Kong to London. 
When we went to check in at Phu Quoc,  we were told that only three of us were booked onto the flight (my husband apparently wasn't ) we showed them all our e tickets, and they just wouldn't accept that my husband was booked on the flight. After being sent to the customer service desk...which is directly opposite the check in desk, we were just being constantly told that my husband wasn't booked onto the flight. After an hour!!!!...my husband was told that he would have to buy another ticket on another flight!!!! During all this, the customer service and check in staff were totally unhelpful and rude. Absolutely no customer care whatsoever. I cannot emphasise enough just how unprofessional, unhelpful and rude they all were.
So, my husband had to buy a ticket for a different flight to us but his left before our flight...you couldn't make it up! So, he rushed off and we three went back to check in...wait for it....only to be told that we weren't booked onto the flight! Even though an hour before they were going to check the 3 of us in. In the hour that we were trying to sort out my husband's new flight, they had just gone and given our flights to other people. The two check in woman were literally laughing at us. They could see our distress but just laughed at us.
We were totally stressed out. We were told that we could buy 3 new tickets, business class only (no surprise there!) and the flight would leave at around 6pm. As we had connecting flights, this was absolutely no good to us whatsoever but as I had no other option, I was prepared to pay for other flights. At this point the 'main' man who told my husband he had to buy a new ticket, came over and said he could maybe put us on stand by...for the flight that we had originally  been booked on!!!!
We then had to wait for around 15 minutes for this extremely rude, unprofessional and unhelpful man to decide whether or not to let us on the flight. Eventually he let us on. He didn't once check his laptop to see how full the flight was or anything like that. I know because I stood right next to him for the entirety of the time he told us to wait. Even when the 15 minute wait was up he just asked for our passports and wrote out a slip to let us on the flight. When we went to check in they wouldn't put our luggage to be put straight through to Hong Kong, so we had to collect our luggage at Ho Chi Minh and as the flight was also delayed, we missed our connecting flight from there to Hong Kong. It was a complete farce. You are completely held to ransom by the staff there. Your on an island. No other options but to buy new tickets when they take you off the plane. Totally money making. 
When we landed at Ho Chi Minh, and got our luggage etc we went to the Vietjet desk to explain that we had missed our connecting flight due to their companies fault, and we were just met with ""buy a new ticket to Hong Kong"" and ""no more flights until tmro""....and then they put their closed sign up !!!!
By this point we have now met my husband at the airport, we are all totally stressed out about how we are going to get to Hong Kong for our midnight connection, and not a single person is interested in helping us.
Customer Service is zero.
Totally uninterested staff.
Rude and unprofessional. 
We eventually did find a woman who did help us to get a flight that evening to Hong Kong. If it wasn't for her help we would have been completely stuck.

Needless to say, she didn't work for Vietjet.

We had to buy 4 new tickets to HongKong plus my husband's other ticket from Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh. The stress we endured was unbelievable.
At Phu Quoc there where lots of other westerners being told that they weren't on the flights they had booked. They were also having to buy tickets/go on stand by.
So, the moral of the story is......NEVER EVER fly VIETJET

In the jet we found a sanity bag with someone's puke front of our seat. It was disgusting!!! It's obviously from the formal passenger and the agents didn't clean up well before our flight. We told one agent in yellow shirt to clean it up but he waved his hand and said nothing with an annoyed face. It was so disgusting and so smelly that we moved the bag away. After he came back he angrily yelled to us like 'why you didn't hold it like I said? I told you I would come back for it!' Excuse me?  He just kept yelling like he really said so. What a big liar you hired Vietjet!   I think we made that very clear the bag is not from us, the agent just didn't want to serve us.
So in Vietnam it's the passenger's responsibility to clean up someother's puke？

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Cheap flight with bad service,"Pros and cons:
Pros: This is the cheapest flight I have ever taken. Round trip, carrying on luggage (7kg) from TPE to HAN only cost me 120 USD. So if you are on a budget but still want to have a get away trip to southeast Asia(or probably just Vietnam), this is definitely one of the cheapest airlines you can find on the internet.

Cons: I bought a bottle of water(1.5 USD) and three pieces of Oreo(3 USD) on the plane. The flight attendants refused to take Taiwanese dollars after their small and short discussion, cause one of them didn't want to do the math and probably couldn't tell the difference of the currency, although they have their calculator next to them and already took Taiwanese dollars from other flyers. 
So I gave them 5 dollars, but them they only gave me 1 dollar back and said ""I don't have 0.5 now. I didn't argue with them to get the money back, cause it was only 0.5 USD. But the attitude of this kind is rather disturbing and frustrating. 

Also the legroom is miserably small, if you're over 175, you might want to choose the bigger seat or the business one.

So overall, if you are the kind of person who are :
1. Looking for cheap flight
2. Short(cause the leg room)
3. Do not like to interact with the flight attendantals

VietJet is probably one of the best flight you can take to Vietnam.",,"[{'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}]"

On the negative side, they are fairly strict in adhering to their carry-on limit and charging for baggage, so take note of that. Also, it is amazing how they have been able to cram so many seats into one airplane.  (I saw one very tall woman (who could only have been Dutch) sitting the entire flight with her feet in the aisle, because it apparently wasn't possible to fit them under the seat ahead of her!) . Because most of their flights seem to be relatively short, however, these things haven't bothered me especially.
On the positive side, their prices are very good (notwithstanding the baggage and food charges), and they are very punctual and incredibly efficient.  Their flight attendants are famously still wearing their short pants (not particularly attractive shorts, but nice nevertheless), which is kind of nice.  
If you take one of their flights, pay attention to the music playing just after landing.  They cycle the English version of Pham Quynh Anh's absolutely gorgeous song Hello Viet Nam.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Truly awful: avoid at all costs,"This is the worst airline I have ever flown with apart from Jetstar. We booked a flight with them in November 2017. About 3 days before we were due to fly I got an email with a different flight schedule. No explanation why, no alternatives offered, just an email, out of the blue, with different booking details. I had to ask 3 times by email before I got an explanation. I was then booked onto a different flight, without being asked whether this is the best alternative for me, and without any other possibilities being offered. Only after I pushed back yet again did I find out that I can take other flights to Hai Phong on the same day, or go to a different destination, or cancel the flight with a full refund. I chose another flight; arranging this was far harder than it ought to have been. Vietjet’s customer service at the airport was just as bad. When we arrived to check-in, and despite paying for 1 checked-in bag on the original booking (the one that Vietjet cancelled without consulting us), we found that on the re-arranged booking we were asked to pay again for the checked in baggage. After a long argument we were left with no choice but to pay an additional Dn.330,000. The team leader who handled the matter at HCMC airport was extremely unpleasant, rude and aggressive towards us. He refused to check the original booking and insisted we had to show our booking to prove that we had already paid this charge. He absolutely couldn’t have cared less that we had had our flight cancelled by Vietjet, and couldn’t care less also about the trouble I had to go to in order to rebook the flight that Vietjet cancelled. Unfortunately there was a problem with the Wi-fi at the airport, and I showed him this on my iPad, but he continued to insist that I had to show my record of the booking, and he continually refused to look up the original booking on his own system, which he could have done easily. When I asked for his name, he became extremely aggressive, covered up his name badge with both hands and shouted a number at us very sharply and loudly. When I asked him to repeat it, he not only refused but became even more rude and hostile towards us. Whilst this was happening, a number of different travellers proactively told us that they also continually have issues with Vietjet and that Vietjet’s customer service is dreadful. When we were leaving the flight I noticed one of the pilots was standing by the exit and he was European so I took the opportunity to explain our experience of Vietjet customer service. His reaction: “On behalf of the company I apologise, but I’m afraid I’ve heard many stories like this”. When even Vietjet’s own employees acknowledge to a passenger they’ve never met before that their customer service is awful, it’s very obvious that senior people in the company know this, but choose to do nothing about it. I won’t be flying with Vietjet again, nor will any of my friends, we’d rather pay a little more and fly with an airline that treats it’s passengers with a modicum of respect. If Vietjet is the only means of getting to a particular destination then we will go somewhere else.",Date of travel: January 2018,"[{'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}]"

1.0 of 5 bubbles,DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE! WORSE AIRLINE EVER!,"If you read this review and still book with Viet Jet Airline, there’s no hope for you...

I was hesitant about flying with Viet Jet Airline from the start. The price of our tickets were too good to be true, but I booked it anyway, in hopes of saving a few extra dollars. I should’ve trusted my instincts and listened to other reviews. I had to learn the hardest that time is ALWAYS more valuable than money. 

My husband I were flying from Ho Chi Minh to Hai Phong to visit Ha Long Bay. We already booked a 2 day/1 night cruise and needed to arrive to the port by 12:30 PM. So we booked the first flight out of Ho Chi Minh at 6 AM. We doubled checked our flight status before our arrival and it still said on time. We even checked the flight status on the flight board and it still said it was scheduled in time. However, upon check in (at 4:30 AM btw), we were notified that our flight was delayed to 8:30 AM. Keep in mind though, this doesn’t account for the time it actually takes to take the bus to the plane and actually board the plane. We started boarding at 8 AM, but we didn’t actually take off until 9:30 AM. Fortunately, we had a super fast taxi driver and our tour was very patient. We barely made it to the boat before the boat left...

We’re so fortunate to have made it to see one of the great wonders of the world, but we were super stressed out throughout the day. Even if it costs more money, just pay the extra $50+ for Vietnam Airlines. It’s not worth going through what we had to go through. If you have extra time and don’t mind saving a few bucks, go ahead and book with Viet Jet Airlines - as it is the equivalent to Spirit Airlines in the U.S., but 100x worse.

Despite what other reviews say, they WILL weigh your carry on when you check in. The weight limit is 7kg (15.4lbs). Once they weigh your bag and it meets the weight restriction, then they will put a band on your bag indicating that your bag is approved for carry on. If your bag is over the weight limit, prepare for some hefty fees and long wait for baggage pick up. Please note that you are also allowed a small purse/bag that is not included in the weight restriction. If you’re lucky and the person you’re with doesn’t care, they’ll  weigh your bag (per protocol), ignore the weight, and put a band on your bag. 

There are no free drinks on board, which they should provide after all the flight delays. You must pay for a drink just like Spirit Airlines. Leg space is smaller and more cramped compared to Spirit and American. It’s built for a typical Asian person and is very uncomfortable for a standard American. Also, if you haven’t flown in Asia before, boarding and getting off the plane with Asian people is madness. They basically herd you like cattle onto a bus to board the airplane. There’s no structure and people push and shove you the entire time - even though we’re all going to the same place anyway. Btw, there’s no such things as lines. People will cut the line no matter what time they arrive. BTW it’s not only Asian people that do this, we ran into some of the most obnoxious Caucasians too. So prepare yourself for the worst. I wish someone told me this before we arrived.

Have I scared you enough to avoid flying Viet Jet? I hope you listened to what I have to say as I sit here and wait at the airport for another delayed flight for Viet Jet.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Late Morning Departure Turned Into Afternoon Flight,"Flight left over 30 minutes late. Late morning flight turned into afternoon departure. It was a full flight. Safe flight so they get credit. The shoe carnival has come to Vietnam. I was there in 2015 but back then passengers did not have to remove their shoes. Now they have bins with images of shoes on the inside so you put your shoes in there and laptop in those with similar images. I guess it's a step up from the U.S. but I always found removing my shoes to be annoying. Sometimes you want to wear a pair of boots that fits just right but is hellish to remove. Thailand has adopted a similar policy with the images on the inside unlike when I was there back in 2015 also. So give yourself extra time to remove your shoes. I went through Incheon airport in Seoul but they are interested in seeing your laptop in a bin by itself. You can keep on your shoes in  Korea.

It's a short flight about 1 hour 15 minutes so don't expect anything to be served. Not even water maybe unless you prepaid. I saw on one of the news forum where a Japanese businessman complained about the price of water and food at the Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok. Security seizes your water- same like in Vietnam. Then while waiting for your flight you get thirsty and need to buy water but the price is a king's ransom. There are some parts of the world where you can drink water from the fountain at the airport and be okay but not all. So I agree with the Japanese businessman who most likely got more money I can ever dream of but yet complains about the price of water and food at the Thai airport.

Upon arrival at HCMC airport it took a while for our luggage to arrive on the carousel. There was not much interaction with the cabin crew so I have nothing negative or positive to comment on them. There was no in flight entertainment. There appeared to be one agent for check-in. One couple held up the line while people waited. This went on for as much as twenty minutes.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"THE WORST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD, BAD COSTUMER SERVICE, DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO BE ON TIME!!!","My name is Juan Miguel Granados Diaz.
Last Monday January 8th I had a flight with VietJet airlines, the flight VJ322 from Phu Quoc Airport (PQC) with arrival destination Tan Son Nhat International Airport. 
The flight was supposed to leave from PQC at 11:30 a.m. with a duration of 35min (according to what the captain said on the flight from SGN T1 to PQC) , arriving estimated time 12:30.
Nevertheless our flight was delayed and we did not start boarding until 1:30 p.m. 
I had booked in advance a flight from SGN to PEK with c in SZX boarding at 2:30 p.m. which I had already pre checked and had no checked bag, so I had enough time to go from domestic flight terminal, go thru security and be on time to board my flight CZ8466.
When I realized in PQC that my flight was so late, I tried to ask them to put me on another airplane going to SGN according to 10.2 terms and condition regarding changes on schedules, but they denied me that opportunity, so I knew it was going to be impossible for me to catch my connection flight CZ8466.
We landed at 2:30 p.m. At the domestic flight terminal, I asked for assistance and they sent me to the Terminal 2 (after telling me there was nothing I could do at all and it was not the airline responsibility) .
Now 3:00 p.m. I went to the costumer service representative of VietJet and I received some of the worst costumer service I have ever received.
First they told me they had nothing to do to help me. They told me that it was not their fault that I lost my connection flight and insisted that the flight was delayed only one hour! 
I showed them my flights schedules and always kept calm expecting that they could solve my situation, instead, the lady who was taking care of me, made me call Southern China Airlines with my own phone, and to learn that they could do nothing to change my connection flight.
Then they told me to wait 2 and a half hours until 5:30 p.m. when the Southern China airlines open their costumer service booth.
The costumer service representative gave me a lecture on why I did wrong on scheduling a flight with short time ( I had more than enough time if the flight would have been on time since I had no check in luggage) and insisting that it was MY FAULT and not the airline fault that i missed my flight , I kept calm, told her I just needed to come home to Beijing in China, and did not needed her lecture. She denied to give me her name, I asked to talk to her manager and she told me she and her other costumer service representative where the managers and there was nobody else I could talk to. 
We went together to the Southern China airlines just to learn that they could do anything to change my flight but to buy a new flight, the VietJet costumer service representative told me there was nothing to do, that the only possibility was that Southern China Airlines would change my flight and they could put me on the January 9th 12:05 flight CZ6042 to Beijing, my final destination ( from SZX I had a flight  CZ3171 leaving to PEK at 20:40, so at 3:00 p.m. I still had at least 3 hours to get to SZX on time to catch my flight) , so she gave me a phone number ( 0162 8217255) and denied, once again to give me her name. She asked to wait until 9:30 p.m. until they open the next flight to Beijing.
At 9:30 p.m. I called the phone and a 3rd costumer representative answered the call, I went to the Viet Jet costumer representative booth and they sent me on my own with a print of cancelled or delayed flight confirmation (that I had to demand for) and it had the wrong time, it said the flight was delayed 1 Hour and 15 minutes, I told her it was not accurate, she made a phone call and changed it to 1 hour and 45 minutes ( which was still not accurate, we were supposed to LEAVE at 11:30 a.m. from PQC and we were BOARDING at 1:30 p.m. and did not LANDED until 2:30 p.m.)
However, it was a completely different person and I did not want to discuss anymore, so I told her it was still un accurate but I needed to see if they could do anything at China Southern airlines, but the answer was negative. 
In the end I spent more than 9 hours trying to figure this out, and receive THE WORST costumer service. They did not help me at all, they did not give me a direct answer, they did not provided de costumer service representative name (either of the 3 people who I talked to ) .
I had to come back home somehow, so I had to  buy online a ticket that costed me another flight that costed me $360.31 out of my own pocket because of the VietJet airlines fault.
*I RECEIVED AND ANSWER SAYING: ""we are also sorry that we can not meet your request of paying any compensation for any extra spending.We do appreciate your understanding and look forward to your cooperation.""

Thing is : English  announcement vs Vietnamese  announcement  was a difference (as my friend said, she's Vietnamese who speak Eng so well).

After all passengers got off the plane, there was none of Vietjet staff on the entrance/gate on land to say sorry to guests, only Noibai Airport Services' staff was there. I know it was not their mistake but official VJ staffs should be there to calm down people.

After half an hour, we got a voucher of 6.5USD for a meal, that should be given right before we were asked to leave the plane.

Then, 3 times, the announcement was raised by the radio that our flight - VJ917 is ready to board however it was also mistakes x 3. Such a joke. Many ppl were eating and rushly finished or left a whole soup to go to boarding gate but nothing happened.

Finally after 4 hours of jokes and delay, we could have got another flight to Yangon, but we missed our booked shuttle night bus to Bagan which cost $40 because of VJ.

We fully understand that sometimes flight delays, but we do not evaluate the unprofessional attitude of VJ, plus an outdated old aircraft bought from China which causes many technical issues.

Our flight has been the 3rd flight in 3 consecutive days VJ delayed and treated passengers like a begger who begged for their seats.

Their baggage allowance is paltry - a mere 7 kg. This was the only flight in SE Asia I took that forced me to check my bags because they were slightly over the allowance. At least they didn't lose or damage the luggage. 

To add to that, the flight was then delayed by close to 3 hours (for what was supposed to be an hour-long flight!) with no explanation and little apology. I suspect they were waiting for a connecting flight, since after about an hour of waiting on the plane, about 10-15 people were hurried on, and we were then allowed to take off.

My friend and I had a connecting flight in HANOI from Busan to Siem Reap.  When we arrived in Hanoi, they were unable to print our boarding passes right away.   The Vietjet ticket counter was closed. If we had a short layover we would have missed out connecting flight.   We just happened to be the only people with a layover in Hanoi.   The staff continued to tell us that we needed to get a VISA for HANOI JUST to get our connecting flight.   So, we were stuck sitting in one room while waiting 4 hours for us to print our boarding passes.   We asked 4 staff members for help who said for us to wait then they never came back to help us.

Eventually, an english-speaking agent helped us print our boarding passes.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Even the ""smooth"" legs of the trip were a headache","This was the trip from hell, even though I had booked my flights and accommodations weeks in advance.  

My first flight on Monday night (Christmas) was grounded due to a possible typhoon, which I totally understand.  But I had no warning of that when I checked in online the night before and only saw it was cancelled that morning when I logged in after hearing
 about the storm from a friend.
 
Eventually they re-booked my flight for days later--the day after my return flight no less--again with no warning or any input from me.  This forced me into a buying a one-way on another airline so as not to lose all my hotel deposits, etc.

Then it happened again.  No warning that they had cancelled my flight and all others from SGN to DAD, that day except for the first and last of the day.  I went from a 2 hour layover to a 10+ hour one, which again required me to book ANOTHER one-way ticket on a different airline.  They didn't tell my booking agency (Kiwi.com) of these changes either--I only learned of them when Kiwi looked into my trip and THEY told me.

On the two (out of 4) legs I actually did take on VietJet, the delays were constant and repeated in 45 minute increments--one took 3+ hours, another over an hour.  Then there is the headache of their gate/bus/boarding process--I'm familiar with the pains associated with flying budget airlines on short trips, but this was another level.  

Once on the plane at 5'11"" tall I was sitting upright and with my knees firmly pressed against the the seat in front of me--luckily my flights were 60 and 90 minutes.  The plane was clean and the crew were nice enough, though not much service was provided on these short flights.

If I have lots of time to kill and am able to get on the first flight of the day and need to save some money, perhaps I'd consider them again.  But NEVER again will I use them for any semblance of a complex or tightly-scheduled trip.  I wound spending twice what I saved by not booking on a better airline in the first place when I had to purchase tickets from them directly anyway.  I've requested the booking agency to seek at least a partial refund from them, no word yet on that, and zero hopes for anything really.",Date of travel: December 2017,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"
1.0 of 5 bubbles,The CS is not helpful,"I had a very bad experience with this airline. Not just the long line at check in counter and staffs with limited English, I would like to write my bad experience here. 
I booked my flight from Danang to Ho Chi Minh, at first I booked without baggage, then after a month, i was curious about the baggage price, thus I went to Manage My Booking from website, I clicked on the added baggage but I never confirm or even pay which I thought the purchase luggage should be automatically cancelled by system since I never pay and do not click the confirmation. I just left the page by clicked on X from my browser. 
Then a day before my flight, I tried to do online check in, however there was a notification that I cant check in since my payment is not completed. I tried to call to the call centre, but never connected and their line always busy. I called to local office but the staff cant speak English. I was desperate and I thought it's the system error since I asked my friend to try check from her mobile and surprisingly the notification from her gadget show different notification ""there is an error"" which is different with the notification on my phone. 
The next morning during the check in, I could not check in, the staff said there's a not completed payment and she asked me to go to ticketing office at the airport to check. 
The ticketing officer said I have to pay for the baggage, I asked him to cancel. But he said he cant do it. Since I donot have any luggage to check in, I asked why should I pay for the baggage check in? His English is bad and his colleague come to explain to me but insist asked me to pay. She said it is from the system then I purchased the checked in baggage thus I have to pay even I do not have any luggage. She said if I do not pay, my friends and I wouldnot be boarded. I showed her my confirmation is without check-in baggege, but she could not do anything. 
For me this is ridiculous, not just her attitude was not very helpful but was also rude.

This hasn't stopped Vietjet classing the whole of row 12 as an extra legroom row and charging a premium to select them.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,First time with Vietjet... positive on most counts!,"This was my first time to fly Vietjet and I have to say that overall it was a quite favorable experience.  The main reason to fly Vietjet to Chiang Mai was cost as the total price for three of us was more than 3,000 baht less than the other usual low-cost carriers (e.g., Air Asia, Thai Lion, Nok, Thai Smile).  The online booking was relatively simple; certainly no more or no less confusing than most, including the usual tricks to try to get customers to pay for things they don't want (e.g., insurance, meals, seat selection, etc.).  On top of that, the usual scam of charging for use of credit card to pay for the tickets.  But, really no worse than most of the others.

We were late in arriving at the airport and very impressed by the speed and efficiency of the desk agent to process us and get us our boarding passes.  Boarding at bus gate was relatively smooth.  Plane (A320) was new and clean.  Flight crew was neat and professional.  Their demeanor was serious, but fun, throughout.  Seats comfortable and with good leg room.  Flight left on perfectly on time.  With low-cost carrier, no meals or snacks without paying, but again this is in line with the competition.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,An interesting contradiction! ,"We flew VJ328 on Dec 4, 2017 from Phu Quoc, to HCMC.  We showed up early and were absolutely delighted with the service we received from the airport staff.  Truly amazing, and wonderful!  At this point they would have gotten an easy 5 out of 5!  

And then we board the plane. . .it was 50 minutes late.  I was seated next to a young German (?) couple who had their tray tables out and had already been served.  I was in seat 1D so they were E and F.  The stewardess tried to get me to move to a different seat, I told her I preferred the legroom in the front.  She then asked if I needed a seatbelt extension.  I explained to her that my belt fit with 5 inches to spare, and wasn't as fat as she thought I was!  Once the doors were closed and I noticed rows 2-4 empty I told her that I would move back a row.  

Shortly after take off the stewardesses focused all their attention on the couple in front of me, ignoring the balance of the passengers.  I'm not sure who these people were, but I've never seen so much favouritism on any flight, anywhere.  Would have let it slide but they landed with their seats reclined and tray tables out, inconveniencing me after I moved back a row to give them some space.  Upon landing we were held back until they could disembark and get into a private shuttle.  Given their age, I suspect they were privileged kids who have never done an honest day's work in their lives, or some celebrity de-jour. It wasn't Justin Bieber. . .

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Acceptable,"First of all, thanks God that I've never experienced with delayed before although traveled a lot for work as well as for leisure. Actually, I received some announcements in advance with around 15' delayed due to ""traffic jam"" which was acceptable and comparing between Noi Bai's grounding facilities and others international airports. Furthermore, who can predict future or weather... 
Back to VietJet Air, a budget airline, I've some experiences:
1- Fare: 
+ Not always the cheapest at a moment, so must compare carefully with others or hunting for promotion codes or throughout an agent.
+ Thinking in advance and make your detail plan: meal or not, drink or not, luggage or not... to buy the package or just a flight ticket only. 
2- Services:
+ Budget airline means budget services or likely a ""public bus"". You can have a chance to see passenger sit on yours; argue to define where is the place for ""hand luggage"" almost in oversize situation; stand up and walk around when not allowed... hearing mobile phone talk-over, chit-chat with upper voice, children's cry...
+ The crew who always facing with those things so can not be nice and try to finish their duties with poor English.
+ Tips: Can bring your own foods; water (for domestic you can bring though the check-point; but for international, remember bring your empty bottle and get the water inside the waiting lounge); light blanket...
3- Others:
+ Spacing: narrow for your legs as well as uncomfortable seats.
+ Condition: some planes are new but some are old, wish for your luck.
+ Cleanliness: sometimes ok but sometimes can't accept due to their rush hour.

I found the plane comfortable. I paid for the emergency exit so I had lots of leg room ($5 US). You pay for everything, including water.  The major issue I had was with the carry on luggage policy. Only 7KG is allowed, that includes everything, so if you have a computer in your hand luggage that technically counts. When I checked in the clerk insisted I weight all my things, my carry on was over weight (9kg), and with my personal bag (inc computer), this came to 12kg (I am used to airlines insisting on the size of the luggage, and my bag would have fit perfectly well in the overhead locker).Anyway, I was told I had to check my carry on  and pay $30 US. The most annoying thing though, was that when I got on the plane,  many of the other passengers had cabin luggage that looked to me like it was in excess of 7kg.

I can say without question that both flights were the best flight experience we have had. The flights both took off on time literally to the second, in flight service was friendly, efficient with lots of smiling faces and the landings the best I have ever experienced, we hardly knew we had touched town.

But when we got to the departures before security we were sent back because the staff guessed that our bags were overweight and needed to be checked in!  We headed back to the check in desk and had the bags checked to be told they were fine.  So we tried again and once again got stopped and told we had to get them weighed and checked in!  We made the staff go to the desk with us and tell them this which they did and then had to pay to check in two of our bags.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst airline I have ever chose. Delayed flights,"By far the worst experience on an airline. First time we flew from BKK-CNX (Bangkok to Chiang Mai) and our flight was delayed 2 hours.They were completely disorganized and not friendly at all.
Second time was HKT-BKK (Phuket to Bangkok). WE purposely booked a flight that would arrive in Bangkok 6 hours before our flight home so that we could enjoy a bit more of the city before heading back home to the states.
Our flight was first delayed 1 hour a few days prior to the actual date. We arrived to the gate 6, waited about 30 minutes and our flight got delayed 30 mins. After waiting for about an hour at our gate was moved to gate 81. As soon as we are about to start boarding and getting in line, our flight was delayed another 30 mins. After those 30 mins were up, they added another 30 mins and finally told us that the weather up in the skies were rough due to some light rain and the captain was not able to see. Eventually they keep delaying the flight 10-30 mins extra and all of a sudden they dont know when our flight will be. We end up clueless on departure time and gate number.
After about 2.5 hours of delays, they decide to move our gate to gate 4. And as everyone is forming a line, they then change the flight time to 16:00(4pm) - mind you our flight was originally for 12:30pm. Everyone starts fussing with the airline team members but they have either no answer or mixed answers. First we were told we would be departing at 4pm then we get told boarding was at 4pm and we would be departing by 4:30pm.
About 15 minutes before the hour, they decide to change the gate umber again to gate 82. As we wait in line they continue to mention the plane still has not came in and then they tell us they are waiting for a bus to pick us up to take us to the plane. 4-5 buses come by and we are all still waiting.
At about 4:15 they finally get us on the bus to get to the plane nearly on the other side of the airport. When on the plane we get told we will be departing by 5pm as flight crew and airline team members run up and down the plane aisle looking confused and worried.
At about 5:00-5:10 a passenger shouts at a crew member questioning what is going on and they say they will now inform us.
Nearly 5 hours delayed before we finally took of. The worst service I have ever received from an airline and will NEVER fly them again.
We finally arrived at BKK at nearly 6:30-6:45.",Date of travel: November 2017,"[{'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

Since our bags had already been checked in we were asked to wait. And we did. And more. And then some more. They couldn’t find our luggage because “there are too many bags”.

When checking into our first flight, I noticed the time of our flight had been moved an hour or two earlier. Concerned, I checked the remaining 3 flights and all of them had been moved up the same. From Hanoi to Da Nang, and Da Nang to Saigon, we had no issues - the flights were on time. From Saigon to Phu Quoc we were delayed 30m, but we actually took off 1h from the original time. It was bearable as the flight time was only 35m rather than the 1h posted on our ticket.  The WORST experience was from Phu Quoc to Saigon. There were no updates on delays or when we would actually take off. Our flight time was 11:30am and the screen with flights never changed our status. We watched as 4 other flights, leaving after 11:30 boarded and left. The screen in the airport showed our flight statuses as 'boarding' and then 'departed' and there was no one at the counter who could give us an answer. We finally asked someone who was boarding passengers on a different flight through our gate who said we'd be boarding after them at 12:30, but we ended up boarding at 1pm. I was particularly annoyed since I had a connecting international flight in Saigon, but heard stories of delays so luckily we chose a flight departing at 4pm, which we had to run for. This is why we had mixed feelings about this airline. They stated that flights were delayed because of late arrivals of the plane in Saigon.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,TERRIBLE customer service ,"My partner and I were scheduled to fly from Da Nang to Phu Quoc via HCM. After fumbling around on their terribly dysfunctional website I finally figured out how to purchase additional baggage. I had to purchase add-on baggage for both legs of the flight but unfortunately due to their website error, one of the payments could not be processed. So we made alternative arrangements to store our baggage elsewhere instead of checking it in. 

When we arrived at HCM (after a 2hr delay) and ready to board our next flight to Phu Quoc (which was also delayed), we were told that our tickets were ‘blocked’ as payment had not been made for the additional baggage. We told them there was a website error and we had already made arrangements to store our luggage elsewhere. 
They insisted we had to pay for the add-on even though we weren’t actually going to use it, saying that it was ‘regulation’ and that nobody could revoke the add-on unless it was paid for. In other words we would not be able to get on our next flight if we didn’t pay for this add-on that we didn’t need.

We decided to pay for it to avoid further hassle and guess what, their credit card machine declined all 4 of our credit cards. The counter staff were very non-chalant about it and did not provide us an alternative solution other than saying go to the ATM and get cash.
The ticketing staff were extremely unhelpful and unprofessional. They were all fixated on their personal phones and chatting to each other rather than doing their job. 
We requested their assistance to call their call centre but they blatantly refused and said they don’t have a phone, saying we had to call them ourselves. 
It was and is a horrific experience dealing with the ground staff and my story probably doesn’t do it justice as to how bad it actually was.
Save yourself the hasssle and book another airline that actually cares about its customers! We are still stuck in HCM waiting for our delayed flight.

 On the third trip I asked for an emergency exit seat at the check-in, and was greeted with the fact that I would have to pay extra. When I explained that I could not fit into the seats , I was told that it was my fault, I should have known, I explained that the distance between seats was not specified on their website. They would accept no responsibility, incorrectly blaming Airbus. I was treated very disrespectfully I was made to feel shameful of my situation.

Then.. on arrival at airport was advised of a further 30 minutes delay. Ok plenty of places to have a coffee and chill.
The eventual departure was 2 hours later than the scheduled time and to be honest the flight, as always, was fine.
The airline has improved check-in and boarding procedures which earns a big tick from me... no more pushing in and queue jumping!
They also accept early check-in, something very foreign to Australian airlines and airports... another big tick!

4.0 of 5 bubbles,VietJetAir and SkyBoss,"As a couple, we visited Vietnam in April of this year and just this past August.  During both visits we flew with VietJet.  In April we took the flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang and had a pretty fraught experience checking in.  As others have written,there seemed to be no control over the check in process with barriers completely ignored, carts ramming into each other, people jumping the line and the check in staff looking miserable.  But, the price was astoundingly cheap and so we just went with the flow and after an hour or so, finally reached check in.  From that point onward, the experience was acceptable; in that once on board, we had paid for the exit row, so the legroom was manageable and the on board pricing of food and drinks was acceptable.  The check in for Da Nang was better organised and a pretty smooth check-in.  On our return from Da Nang, I noticed a VIP entrance for SkyBoss and jokingly said, 'Next time we give that a go!'  So, when we decided to return to Vietnam after falling in love with it in April, we took the plunge.
We knew from the reviews that delays are almost inevitable, and because we were flying to Hanoi on the same night we came in from the UK into Ho Chi Minh, we wanted to have flexibility of changing the ticket.  I have to say, it was a delightful experience throughout.  The dedicated check-in line was visible and it took less than ten minutes.  We went through the Fast Track security and welcomed to the huge, comfortable lounge with complementary food, drink and WiFi.  We were taken in a private van to the plane and boarded first in the front row.  The crew took our luggage and put them in a designated locker.  We were given water and a towelette, a choice of meal and drink on board and were the first to exit the plane and covered from the rain with an umbrella to the private van to take us to the baggage area-our bags were first off of the plane.  We had only upgraded to SkyBoss on the one flight, but immediately went online to upgrade our next two flights during our trip.  Yes, the price can be several times the price of a low fare; but, for the extras, especially changing flight times, we felt it was worth it.  The Lounge at HCMC and Hanoi were great, the one at Phu Quoc was a huge disappointment-but this is not the fault of the airline.  
We did experience a flight delay from Phu Quoc to HCMC and were informed a few hours before via an email, this gave us time to request a later check out and we had more time to swim!  There was however, further delay at the airport, but the pilot did apologise and kept us informed during the entire flight. The crew were efficient and polite and remembered us from our flight in.  All of the announcements were in both Vietnamese and English.  
I can see that the delays can be very frustrating and that is why I gave them only 4 stars.  In fact, we would have lost precious time in Ho Chi Minh City before we flew back to the UK as a result; however, ironically, our homeward bound flight with a major international airline was delayed for 48 hours due to weather.  I do think that for their general and promotional economy, much could be done to help the check in process to be organised and much less fraught-for everyone involved.  But, for the SkyBoss, I would rate it a 5.  I do also agree that if you are counting on connections, or have little time to waste, no matter what ticket you ride on be sure to check the current status of departures and arrivals-including other domestic flights to get a picture of possible issues before booking.  Also, make sure you have access to your emails for updates and/or the airports flight status updates.  One final tip is that we definitely noticed the difference in check-in and departure organisation when there are less flights taking off in certain time windows; so if possible, try to book in a window with fewer of these.",Date of travel: August 2017,"[{'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

My flight was early morning at 6:50am out of Tao Yuan International (TPE) to Ho Chi Minh (SGN). I traveled as a backpacker, with no check-in luggage. I carried a 40L backpack (Osprey Farpoint 40) as my carry-on luggage and had no problems. The check-in process at the airport was smooth. Do be aware of the luggage limits, though. I saw a few people arguing with the airline people about weight and number of luggage. If you're going to check in luggage, I suggest buying it beforehand.

Our flight was full. I had paid the the extra $1 or something for priority seating in the first few rows. Seat was decent enough. For the price of the flight, which came in around US$100 one way, I can't really complain. 

Was this the best flight ever? Definitely not, but anyone thinking this super budget airline is going to be anything but a budget flight is kidding themselves. I have heard that all the Vietnamese airlines are fraught with delays, so if you're booking connecting flights via other carriers, I'd be more weary and give yourself a few hours between flights to minimize the chance of missing a connection.

One of our flight numbers was changed as well, also passing all this information on to our hosts at the other end arranging private transfers was quite distressing as we had to constantly keep advising them of the changes.  We don't have an email contact when travelling and use different phone sim cards so we had to constantly keep checking hotel computers to keep on top of this.  This airline is terrible with time management and shouldn't sell tickets for times that are not available. If you don't have a private transfer waiting at the other end, then I can say the flight was good and safe, half the price of Vietnam Airlines and we got there in the end which is important.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Heed the many negative reviews,"The hunderds of negative reviews here do make it a pattern.  I wish I had checked them out first before booking.

First, you might be directed to Vietjet from price comparison sites like Skyscanner thinking they offer the cheapest prices.   But the price quoted excludes luggage, seat selection and food.  Add any additional “fees” and the hassle factor and it is just not worth it.

Best advice is not to use Vietjet but rather go with Vietnam Airlines or any other more reputable discount airlines.  There is unfortunately a culture of exploiting the foreigners which can easily be forgiven but to see it institutionalised is sad.  If you’ve booked multiple trips already like I did and are looking to salvage the situation, below are some tips.

First, beware the website is very misleading.  Like enda77 said it can show you have a luggage allowance on booking, even if you have a screenshot, you turn up at the airport you are given some excuse about it not being on the fare based on what ground handling have on the screen.  After you have selected your ticket, what the website shows you is the luggage allowance on other fares!  The ground handling company (Vietjet do not staff their own desks in the region) will apologise profusely, assume you will pay, pretend it is some kind of upsell, call Vietjet managers but ultimately come back to say they can do nothing.  Beware that the “excess luggage” and “desk service” charge is double to triple that online so it can exceed the airfare itself.

One protection if you have booked already is to buy excess baggage in all cases.  It is going to be cheaper than the hassle at the check-in desk.  Be sure you have “Add Ons (0) - Goi (Bag) 20kgs 330,000 VND” on all tickets, requested an email confirmation and printed it out. 

If you try to pay by credit card you will get a failed transaction.  Avoid being tempted to pay with another card.  If you do call Vietjet you will be told you can click on a “Pay Later” button.  On multiple tests of booking a ticket, the “Pay Later” button sometimes appears on the website, sometimes it does not.  It also does not guarantee you a ticket for travel if you opt to pay later.  Do ring your credit card company immediately.  Your card company will tell you all the “failed” transactions the Vietjet website reports actually went through on the card company side.  It is up to you to block the transactions you do not want with your card company to avoid double or triple paying Vietjet.

Beware that if you had clicked on the print button on the website the “Your Confirmed Itinerary” printout does not state your: flight time, departure airport, arrival airport or any basic and useful relevant information you went through on the booking screens.  It only has sections the “booking number, primary reservation contact information, reservation charges and travel insurance.”  It does not state the terms and conditions of carriage such as baggage allowance and excess baggage conditions.  You must ensure you have received the emailed itinerary and printed that out to cover future desk staff challenges.  The two documents are different.

You absolutely must have your booking number or you can be denied boarding as others have observed!  Unlike the rest of the world’s airlines the passport alone is not sufficient.  Vietjet do not have their own staff but their ground agents will apologise profusely for carrying out the airline’s policy until you find the printout with the booking number on it.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Blatantly Inconsistent Service,"This flight was less than half full and as the final passengers embarked and the doors closed, some Thai and/or Chinese passengers moved to vacant seats to give themselves more room.

As I was sitting three abreast, I moved one row forward to the three empty seats on the emergency exit row.

A flight attendant immediately pounced and ordered me back to my seat.  When I asked why, she said it would confuse the meals service delivery.   I explained that I had not ordered a meal, and as this empty seat was not going to get a meal anyway, I could not see any confusion.   She was not moved by my logic and ordered me again to resume my allocated seat, which I did.

No sooner had we taken off than many more passengers moved to spare seats, including one person who took the seat I had previously moved into.  As the flight attendant passed, I asked her why she was not ordering them back to their seats.   

She then totally changed her argument and said I was too old to sit in a seat on the emergency row.   This is arrant nonsense.  While I am 71 years old, I am fit and exercise and work out daily.   I frequently sit in emergency exit rows, sometimes paying extra for the privilege.

When I pointed out that she had totally changed her explanation, she went into sarcastic mode, and kept saying ""Thank you for your understanding"", in a smarmy tone of voice.

I had had enough, so found the senior flight attendant and pointed out the anomalies in the treatment I was receiving and that of the many other passengers who had changed seats.  She said it was quite in order for me to change seats, as long as I resumed my allocated seat for landing.

This was totally at odds with the two different stories I had been told before.

I can only assume that the flight attendant took umbrage at my questioning the reasons for her wanting me to resume my original seat and was determined to stick to her guns.

On top of that the staff are the worst I have ever encountered out of any budget airline.

   2 weeks in advance, I booked 2 return tickets with Vietjet Air for me and my partner for a trip between Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh city (HCMC) on July, 2017. This was for our international flight-off from Ho Chi Minh. within that time, I receives flight changes 4 times, all by sms, including once on the actual departure date 12th July. This, bitterly, was after we were confirmed checked-in online. 

   Having said that, in the previous calls to Customer service (+84 19001886), I was told and even got confirmation emails that our flight had been confirmed. However, as we were just ready for our trip to HCM City, just by a sms 5 hours before departure time, they shifted our flight time 3.5 hrs forward which made our overseas connecting flight impossible. I called again and got told the rest of other time slots were full including our already checked-in flight! 

   The result: we were forced to throw away 2 Vietjet Air tickets from DAD-SGN and bought 2 business-class instead with Vietnam Airline (another sub-standard airline). This cost us 3 times premium as a Vietnam Airline economy option would cost. We Were not sure what's gonna happen to the Vietjet Air return flight from SGN - DAD but we still felt very very lucky to reach HCM City and have enough time before the international departure time.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Do not use this airline! There are better options.,"Arrived into Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) airport with hours to spare.  When I was allow to check my bag for the next flight was given a hard time about my carry on bag which has my 3 expensive cameras but told go ahead.  As I was going into the security check, another Vietjet employee waves me over, weighs my carry on bag and says I have to go to a desk to pay an over weight fee which I am fine with then that person says I have to go back where I started!  I go back and I am forced to check this bag, thankfully I keep a bag inside my carry on bag that has the cameras, so I pull it out and check in a near empty bag.

Next, my friend arrives at the airport where we wait..... and wait, yes, our flight was delayed about 2 hours.  While waiting we see we were not the only delayed Vietjet Airlines flight.  Then the boarding of the plane was less than organized.  So we finally leave and arrive in Hue a little over 2 hours late.  Our driver from the hotel, while driving asked how we were doing, and we mentioned the late flight.  Our driver laughed some and then stated that it is common for Veitjet Airlines to have late flights.

At the end of our trip, my friend and I were in the Hanoi airport waiting for our flight back to Bangkok Thailand (AirAsia flight), I hear see on a flight listing sign at the airport and it shows a delayed Hanoi to Bangkok flight.  I say to my friend, ""oh great, another delayed flight.""  He points out it is not our AirAsia flight but rather one from Vietjet Airlines.  We were happy that we were not using Vietjet at that point.  He and I both discussed it and have decided we will not use Vietjet Airlines again.

                  the tour
               0710PM - we were late for the bus so our driver called the bus line and just 
               waited for the bus somewhere. MY SISTER DISCOVERED SHE LOST HER WALLET. Could not think where she lost it or could not remember when she last saw it. the bus was approaching so we just had a quick talk with our taxi driver to check his cab. Nikhan who had been so nice told us he will check back with all the places we visited and handed his business card.
           0800PM- boarded to bus going to BAGAN without Jessica's wallet. She was crying as all her money, IDs, atms and credit card was there. I told her we will message all the possible places where she could have left it. The hotel where we stayed in Ho Chi Mihn, Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Vietjet, Yangon airport. To our dismay, we could noty find any wifi signal. we had no choice but to rest it off.
 June 28 - 0500AM- we arrived at Bagan, left our backpacks at the bus station and proceeded with the tour. 
               1200NN - we asked our driver Mamau if we can use his phone to contact Nikhan. We were told by Nikhan he had everything checked but none of the places found Jessica's wallet. he assured us that he will still try to look around.
               0900PM-  We left Bagan 
June 29  - 0800AM - arrived back at Yangon where we were met by Nikhan at the bus station. he showed us the CCTV footage when we visited the temples. None of which she could heave left her wallet.

                1040AM- we were running like crazy inside Ynagon International airport so we will not miss our flight to Bangkok. Nickhan had asked the airport if they found a black wallet but there was none. We didn't have the time to check it at the Vietjet counter. 
                 0100PM- we arrived at Bangkok (Collected another $15per person. Paid for my sister since she didn't have her wallet)
                 0300PM-  we arrived at our hostel and was able to check our emails. We noticed an email sent to my business email address sent on June 27th from Vietjet notifying us of a wallet found inside the plane!!! We didn't bother to check my business email since my sister sent all the emails looking for her wallet using her personal email add. It didn't occur to me that they will reach out to me using the email address I used to book our flight. My sister exchanged emails with the person in charge and requested her wallet to be sent to Suvarnabhumi airport where she can pick it up on July 2nd before going back to manila. Everything went well and we proceeded with the trip.

Travelling on a budget this airline is the same standard as all other budget airlines, however their on time performance is not the best (which I'd seen on other reviews).

Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang - we were delayed but luckily it was an evening flight and we were only heading to the hotel afterwards.

Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City - this delay was stressful.  We had given ourselves 3.5 hours transit time in Ho Chi Minh City for our onward international flight with another airline.  Our bag was given ""priority"" tags but it was literally the last bag to come through the baggage claim.  I had run onto the international terminal to speak with the check-in staff (as it was almost 1 hour before departure and check-in was closing) and my travelling companion waited for the bag.  It is only that I was at the international terminal begging the check-in staff to remain open that we managed to make our onward flight.

VJ814	17/06/2017	Eco	17:55 - Singapore - Terminal 3 (SIN)
19:00 - Ho Chi Minh (SGN)

My wife, had also contacted her airline (Air Asia) to cancel her flight to Ho Chi Minh City and has liaised with Air Asia to process a refund on the flight ticket. 

Thus, I contacted VietJetAir Airlines to submit for request of refund or any form of alternatives.

Reason being, her sister and my sister in law, is currently critically ill and admitted to hospital in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The doctor has advised that she is still in critical condition and unstable. Thus, being the close and only family members in Singapore, we are unable to fly out to Ho Chi Minh City. My sister in law is only 33yrs old and is suffering from a very Rare Autoimmune Disease which up till now, doctors are unable to detect what is the caused of her sickness. Doctors conducted blood tests, phlegm test and biopsy however doctors could not find any infections or bacteria and thus unable to find a proper cure for her sickness.

Thus, we seek the airline's kind consideration to allow the following options:

1) To refund the flight ticket cost as a gesture of goodwill due to critical health condition (life/death situation) 

OR

2) Allow to change the date of departure to another future date so that I can fly with VietJet Air again. (8th Sep or 9th Sep 2017) 

We hoped the airline can understand what we are going through and place some empathy to our situations. I had also attached the following Doctor's Letter on my sister's critical condition for their consideration to allow on one of the option above. 

However VietJet Call Centre staff Ms Hoang Lan replied and informed that  Due to their terms and conditions, Vietjet ticket is non-refundable so we're sorry but we can't support you in this case. Besides the flight date had passed so the ticket is no more valid on our system, please book a new ticket.
 
WHY WOULD I WANT TO BOOK A NEW TICKET?!!!!!!! I am flabbergasted by the airline's way of handling the situation.

Please do not use them! They are unhelpful and their ethics are disgusting. There was a lack of customer service and attention. I had recently booked and paid for a ticket from HK to Saigon. I had also checked in online before my flight and had a printed ticket as well as a ticket on my mobile phone. I got to the airport security check-in area and was denied entry, stating that I needed an official boarding pass issued by the check-in counter. I then proceeded to the check-in counter at T2, but there was no one there and this was 1 hour before they were due to close. I was then assisted to T1 to go and check-in and that counter was also closed. There was no one from Vietjet at either terminal, and security denied me entry at both terminals. Because of the incompetence of the Vietjet staff and airport security I missed my holiday. What’s the point of having online check-in and home printing boarding passes and electronic boarding passes if you’re unable to use them?

I do not mind limited leg rooms, purchased bags or all the typical requirements of the budget airline.

I find it unprofessional to change schedule, and rude not asking people, especially when you got changed to a very early flight that you are not gonna be able to make.

They offered nothing as far as food or any other compensation for this oversight, they only took a picture of our boarding passes. Being foreigners on this flight we were not sure what more we could do given the language barrier. Upon arrival at TPE, we immediately approached the VietJet counter and told them of our issue.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,value deal,"First off, a disclaimer: booked the flight because it was on sale. That said, the service and scheduling were OK. There were other reviews on TA and elsewhere highlighting that flights get cancelled often with Vietjet. Didn't happen to me. It could be because it was an international route (SGN to HKG, one-way) and the cancel & herd-together trick would get real expensive to pull off when one of the airports is abroad, and no idea how that trick might operate if herding together not only the passengers but also their paid checked-in baggage weight. Don't know. 

Service was good. Check-in, board, deplane all went smoothly enough. As this is a LCC, food is served per order only. Didn't order any or buy on the spot. 

While the short skirt uniform may have its attraction, the flight was headed to HKG on a February evening when it was rather chilly in HKG, and it just so happened that the flight deplaned on tarmac with connected buses, so that everyone including cabin crew had to walk outside to get on & off the buses before arriving at the terminal in HKG.

Later at 19h05, we found out that our flight is once again delayed to 20h30 with no explanations. We finally got on the plane at around 21h00. Once we got on the plane, we were still not ready to depart because of issues with head counts on passengers on board. We were only able to depart at 23h30.

We were told later on by the captain at 22h00 that the initial aircraft that was supposed to arrive at 18h30 had a mechanical error therefore they needed to bring in a smaller aircraft. 

The cabin crew were nice and kept smiling despite angry passengers yelling at them. What I didn't appreciate was that no one communicated to the passengers what was happening.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Pure disorganized chaos,"Experienced the most disorganized chaos on my flight from Danang to Ho Chi Minh. Our flight was scheduled for 5:15 pm to land at 6:30 pm. However we didn't land until 1:30am. Before we boarded, there was no communication that the flight was being delayed. The departure time would come and go and then they would post a new time 30 minutes later. This happened over and over. But the chaos began when boarding actually began!

When we began boarding, they started pulling people aside saying a system error double booked our seats. Somehow only foreign travelers were being pulled aside, while locals were clearly being let on. This was extremely obvious. Panic set In as people were extremely concerned they weren't going to get on the flight they purchased. Once we were on, they let too many people on the flight and started walking back and forth and counting people. No joke, they counted at least 30 times. They began checking every single boarding pass multiple times. Unfortunately the person up front took some people's boarding passes but not others when checked in. This went on for hours. The worst part was there was zero communication about what was going on. Finally about 5.5 hrs in, an announcement was made. They told us:
1) the aircraft broke down so they brought a new one which was way smaller so not enough seats for all that were assigned.. what?! Why would you bring a smaller plane and not have a plan for the remainder of the people!!!
2) people snuck past the gate desk. How?!?! That's a security issue
3) people were going to be left behind... unacceptable!
4) they began reading off names and checking every ticket vs their list. Pure panic set in as people didn't know if they would be called off the plane.

Extremely poor communication that took way too long to explain. Completely disorganized. The flight crew was even visibly upset. When someone tried to record what was happening, their phone was taken away. I understand this airline is cheaper than others, but it's really easy to control some of these simple things.

On board the flight was comfortable with reasonable legroom... a taller person ie > 180cm may have difficulties on a longer haul but its horses for courses isn't it?

2.0 of 5 bubbles,You get what you pay for,"So my husband and I picked this airline for the cheap airfare prices. Big mistake...we should've paid a little more to fly with Vietnam Airlines. Our original departure time was for 6pm and Vietjet changed the departure times on us 3 times (over a course of 4-6 weeks). Our flight status indicating the new departure time was not updated at all on any internet sources ie: Google flights, Hanoi Noi Bai Airport Departures, etc. Our final departure time was for 10pm. 

We decided to fly ""Premium"" and paid more for our seats (they charged me twice for my seat and in the end, we just sucked it up and paid for the extra charge because at the same time we trying to pre-pay for our checked baggage ahead of time to avoid any further wait times at the airport). By the way, their phone numbers on their website ""does not exist"" when we tried calling from a Vietnam line. 

When we arrived at the airport, we wanted to confirm the departure time with Vietjet just to be 100% sure (as mentioned above, it was not updated anywhere, Google, flight tracker and Hanoi airport departures still had our flight for the original 6pm departure time). When I got to the desk, I was the only person standing right in front of them at the counter.... I didn't want to be rude and just interrupt them so I stood there and patiently waited for 1 of the 3 representatives to acknowledge me. No one did, they all avoided eye contact with me and were ""busy"" typing away at whatever they were doing. Then 2 local travellers came up to the counter beside me and just asked away for help. So then I copied and just interrupted one of the agents and asked her to confirm my flight which she did. But I think that is still poor customer service. 

The flight: The airplane itself was average and I have nothing bad to say about it. But when my husband and I boarded, there was a man in our seat that we paid for. We told the flight attendant and she said to just sit in the seats next to him for now (as we were holding up a line of people behind us) so we agreed. She said that she will address the matter once everyone has seated. This never happened. She did not once come back to address the matter. My husband and I didn't care too much that he was in our seat but I suppose it's the principal that mattered. She didn't come to us until the end of our flight to apologize about our seat. At least she apologized. Water was not provided on the flight, if you wanted something, you would have to pay for it. They were advertising their airline merchandise over the PA throughout the flight. Everything is chargeable on this airline. 

Unfortunately, we will not be flying with this airline again and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

The planes were quite old, with the safety messages on the seats in English and Russian, which made me think they were bought second-hand. Also not very clean but the staff were nice.

On the way back, Vietjet said at check-in that even though our eticket said we had paid for checked luggage that it wasn't on their system so we would need to pay again, but they gave in in the end after we protested politely.

The checked-in luggage allowance was only 15kg and hand luggage 7kg which we weren't aware of until we had bought the flights, which made packing interesting.

However the luggage policy is really confusing, and I think it is deliberate. When I booked our tickets, I knew we would have to check in luggage, so had there been an option to buy this at time of booking (which you have for all European budget airlines), I would have done so.  

The day before our flight I searched luggage policy for this airline, as I wanted to check permitted weights of hand and hold luggage. It was not easy to find information for international flights, but I eventually did find written that 15kg hold baggage was free. However at the airport we discovered we hadn't paid for luggage and it was a lot more expensive to pay at the desk, 60 US dollars for 2 bags! The lady at the desk mentioned that a lot of people make the same mistake ..... hmmmm!

The flight tickets were reasonably cheap, and I understand that budget airlines charge for checked in bags, however what I don't like is this airline deliberately making their luggage policy unclear for their customers, and at the airport you have no choice but pay up.

Checking in process is a nightmare. My husband and I knew from a previous fight that you had to pay for checked bags so we tried to pay for the bags before check in, which was clearly too efficient for VietJet... so we headed to check in counter, waited forever, and then they held our bags and passports hostage while we paid for our checked bags at a different counter (and yet another line). At the counter to pay for the checked bags, the VietJet woman was extremely rude, took personal phone calls and charged us 1.300.000 vnd for two checked bags (double what we paid on our last VietJet flight). AND the woman in line behind us, who was Chinese, got charged 60.000 vnd for her one checked bag and was helped before we were.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Not worth the low air fares,"I live in Vietnam so have flown Viet Jet qutie a few times in the past year and a half for both work and pleasure. But after several bad experiences I will avoid flying this airline again. Not only have they drastically changed my flight times more than once, this last time they did so with little advance warning. At least before, I received an email the day before warning of the change (usually changing a morning flight to late afternoon or evening). But this time, the email came through about 45 minutes before flight was supposed to depart and of course when I and rest of the passengers were already at the airport.  Even the crew showed up and were turned away!  They gave weather as a reason for the change, but the weather was clear in both departure and arrival city. The staff tried to be accommodating but there was not much they could do.

The other issue is how they handle baggage. It is not made clear on your e-ticket or website if baggage is included or requires an extra fee. You can do web check-in the day before, which I usually do, but the website does not allow you to select number of bags or pay any fees then. So when you arrive at counter to check bags they tell you that you have to pay a fee and then send you to another counter to pay it. So you have to wait in yet another long and slow line before going back to finish checking your bag. And the baggage allowance can change for your return flight. Our return flight allowed only 15 kilos for checked baggage and only 7 kilos for carry on. This is nothing! So we had to pay a bigger fee. And though I didn't have to check my bag for the departure flight, only my husband did so, for the return we had to check both. But didn't learn this until my husband had already gone to the other counter to pay his bag fee. He then had to return again to pay for mine. All this time, I refused to budge from the booking counter so as not to lose my place because there were too few counters and too many passengers and much confusion over bags. It was a nightmare!

Embassy said ""no don't need it"" in my situation since I am only in airport for 2 hours and will not be leaving through Immigration. I could find no information saying I needed it on VietJet Air's booking website. I paid for ticket and then booked connecting flight from HCMC to Bangkok with Jetstar (with a 2 hour layover in HCMC International Airport). Upon arriving at Taipei Check-In counter they refused me to allow me to board without a transit visa! I was gob-smacked that their website doe not state this. After all they are a national Vietnamese carrier.  So they give me a web address to apply for urgent visa (which takes up to 2 days and they said would cost another $90!). Then while I am applying for it they close the check-in counter! I missed the flight and they would not re-imburse any money including money I paid for baggage & extras etc (which is ridiculous considering they didn't take any of my baggage.

No notification. No excuse. No apology. When asked why we were not notified, we got told because we booked it through a booking agent.. crappy excuse!
When it came to landing in Nha Trang the weather was really bad. Crazy turbulence and sick people all over the place. The pilot was in the process of landing the plane but had to speed up because of technical difficulty. In the process, they realized they did not have enough fuel to circle and land again. So back to HCMC!
We sat on the plane for about an hour to refuel. Then were told to get off, went back to the terminal building and got boarded again?!?!
Long story short, we arrived in Nha Trang after 5pm that afternoon. Again no apology. No offer of a discount or a voucher. Weren't even offered a free water or a snack! Not even for the passengers who were sick!

Today we had a 9am flight booked from Nha Trang to Hanoi. Arrived at airport in time to be told the flight had been postponed to 7:30pm!!! Again. No notification. No excuse. No apology.

Checking in was quick at both airports and the planes are your usual Airbus planes so no real complaints there. 2 return tickets was £150 approx. and the flight was 75 mins each way so the cost was on a par with many European flights. We were advised a week before we went to Vietnam that we would fly to Danang at 10am rather than 12.30pm so I assume that if they haven't filled their flights they consolidate.

The service was good & professional. They just changed flight schedule 2 times for my flight from Hanoi to Da Nang. We got an email 2 times a few days before departure to tell us about the changes so make sure you check your email regularly for updates. They are very strict with carry on weight so make sure you are only bringing a carry on for 7KG total for 2 items. They will add everything together at the aiport. We ended paying around $35 CAD in fine as my carry one suitcase and back pack was over 7KG total. You can only have 1 check in suitcase per person at 40-50lbs max so make sure to pack light and not too much. The seats were not that comfy as the cushion thin so best to only use VietJet for short flights within Vietnam.

Secondly, their counter service is miserable. 1) How do you not allow ticket purchases at the airport? This is the 21st century and you need to get with the times. 2) How about you train your employees to be a bit more helpful instead of pushing someone aside?

Sum of it all - I will go out of my way in the future to avoid you. And the worst part is; you probably won't read this, won't make any improvements, and your horrible airline will continue to chug along.

If you're in the airline industry, look at the example of what the big ones are doing - they are keeping the safety rules mostly unnoticed to the passangers and offering high quality of customer service.
They changed the departure time several times, and we have only received vietnamese e-mails about it.
The only real positivity is that the tickets are cheap.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Delayed but okay once re-sheduled,"I had to book VietJet because the flight I was booked on with Vietnam Airlines - who I usually fly with - was re-sheduled. I'd read the warnings about VietJet but had no other option as I needed to fly that evening. So I bought a ticket online and made a big error. When filling in the online form don't let Google auto complete fill in your name and address. I did and Google missed out my middle name. In my haste I didn't notice before completing and so I had an online ticket with a name that didn't match the name in my passport - which has my middle name. VietJet have two options when this happens. Charge you $15 if you contact them and change it three hours before flying, or, buy a new ticket. Luckily my Vietnamese business hosts did it for me and I was okay. On arrival at Ho Chi Minh City domestic the queues for VietJet were chaotic. Loads of people with massive bags pushing in. Staff directing travellers to various checkin counters then changing their minds. Lines being ignored. Late travellers pushing to the front. Never again. Too much stress after a long flight from London via Bangkok. After checking in - and after another push-and-shove experience through security you are directed to the VietJet departure area where I discovered the flight was delayed an hour ""due to the late arrival of the aircraft"". Fine, I had some food and a drink while I waited. Once the flight was called the boarding was efficient and fast. The plane was decent enough for a short flight. The staff were friendly, and my luggage came off quickly. So, all in all, not a bad experience in terms of the flight - it's just the delay and the chaos at checkin that let them down.",Date of travel: November 2016,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

When the time comes, I didn't receive any more delayed messaged but when I checked out the flight board, it said my flight was further delayed until 10:30pm. I have to say this was one of the worst night at the airport when all I did was just sitting there and anticipating when the next delay going to be. As for the price, Vietjet is cheaper when I book it close to the day, but if I book a week ahead then definitely check out Vietnamairline and Jetstar first because their prices are actually cheaper than Vietjet in my opinion, also I never had any delay with them.

Well above average in all areas for a budget airline, indeed, given that I paid under a quarter of the price for 'economy' on the 'other' airlines..?   I'll be using this one in the future, thank you!

Expecting unrealistic standards when you know (exactly) why you are risking the odd delay, discomfort or an older, grubby aircraft is part and parcel of the 'Budget' concept.

So (don't) get over it.   It keeps us pragmatic people happy in knowing why we are enjoying an above standard service while we are saving a heap of money.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,not exactly the best airline of the world...,"I got the first problems at the online reservation! at the beginning i found a basic rate which was about 2 usd for a single way and of course I booked it, but after the full procedure, instead of a booking confirmation, I got an error message which brought me back to the home page... I started the procedure again but the price rised to 12 usd... well ok, let's do it anyway... I fill in everything again, including credit card information and I hope that now it works... result? same as before! i took the last attempt and, big surprise, the price rised again to about 20 usd (plus taxes of course)... I think that's not fair at all...
Second problem with the online check-in... whole procedure went through and I could print out the boarding pass, but... but it wasn't a boarding pass!!! I understood it only at the airport when they blocked me and told me to go to counter for check-in... well, be REALLY very careful because if you use to print out the boarding pass by yourself and go to the airport just 40-50 mins prior to departure, you will be denied to access the gates and check-in is already closed!!!
only good points were the arrival airport (which is the main reason why I choosed this airline) in Bangkok: Suvarnabhumi (the newest one) instead of Don Mueang where all low costs use to fly.

Seats could have been a bit more comfortable, but really, no worse than any other airline and better than some. Staff was courteous on the plane. I have no complaints at all. 

As an aside, regardless of what airline I'm arriving on in Noi Bai (Hanoi), I always take the Vietjet bus into the city. The drivers will take you right to your destination - door-to-door- and for 40,000 dong (less than $2), it's a great deal. No need to haggle over the price, and it's almost as fast as taking a private car. 

Second aside: I had the cheapest ticket on this flight to Bangkok and needed to change the departure date. This was no problem, did it online, and paid only a minimal fee - about $30 - to cover processing the change and the difference in the price of the new flight - much cheaper than booking a new flight.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Vietjet Airlines - Is this as bad as it gets?,"This Vietnamese airline caters primarily for domestic flights but does have a few international flights to destinations such as Bangkok, Taipei and Siem Riep. It is a budget airline with a below budget service and a below budget timetable. This warning comes from my own experience in July flying Hanoi to Bangkok and return.

Firstly my departure time from Noi Bai Airport was delayed by two hours causing me to miss my connecting flight Bangkok to Udon Thani. That cost me money.

But they saved the best until last and their supreme effort was on my return leg, Bangkok to Hanoi. My scheduled departure time was 2.15pm. I dutifully arrive at the airport at 11.30 am only to be told that my flight had been rescheduled unexpectedly and had left at 10.30am. Great stuff! No notification by SMS or email was received and no matter how hard I tried on their third rate website I could not find out from my booking details if there were any changes to the flight status. After proving that I had not been informed of any changes they reluctantly and without apology re-routed me to Hanoi via Ho Chi Minh City which added a further 4+ hours to my trip.

Domestically this airline is famously unreliable regarding departure times and delays. ALWAYS check every few hours as to the status of your flight. Their consistent changes to flight schedules can leave you stranded and out of pocket.

Their customer communication service ranges from very poor to non-existent meaning that don't expect them to inform you of any flight delays/changes or cancellations. Their online web booking page is confusing and amateurish. Checking flight status is an impossibility as I found out.

Their aircraft are not always true to label. My return flight HCMC to Hanoi was on some unbranded clapped out old rattle trap of an aircraft with a worn out and dirty interior. It was not in the traditional Vietjet colours and logos. It was painted white with some obscure name and numbers on it and to add mystery the Head Flight Attendant was a western lady in some unidentifiable uniform which looked Russian. Weird!

Also worth reporting that Vietjet became famous a few years ago for delivering a plane load of passengers to the wrong destination. How that could happen is anyone's guess but they managed to take a plane load of people going to Dalat and deliver them to Nha Trang.

My recommendation is that if you want to get where you want to go on time then avoid Vietjet if you can. Leave it to the Vietnamese who for budget reasons seem to be able to tolerate all that is wrong with an airline. Although to their credit I will say Vietjet's in-flight staff are always happy, helpful and smiling.

On the other hand if you are not fussed about being delivered to the correct destination on time try Vietjet Airlines. It can bring a bit of fun and excitement to your life; a bit like a mystery tour.",Date of travel: July 2016,

Checkin, boarding, arrival etc... All Good!
Staff are always courteous and the aircraft clean, modern and well maintained.
My latest flight was no different... very smooth and essentially on time.
The only complaint I have about flying domestically in Vietnam is not a fault of the airline... but when queuing to check in or board, there are always people blatantly jumping the queue... why, WHY do people in Vietnam do this? And why do others accept it? I see able bodied young males pushing past older people, families etc.
For GOODNESS SAKE... everybody will get on the aircraft, we all have allocated seats, and everybody gets off at the destination.
Having said it is not the fault of the airline, perhaps ground staff need to be more diligent in ensuring it doesn't happen. It must upset people and I am sure on occasion it causes angst and anger.

Live customer service was useless and insulting. Emailed complaint was equally frustrating and got called liars. First flight left 1.5 hrs late. second flight left 2.5 hrs late.

Staff had to check the plane for explosives because of concerns caused by the two people exiting the plane. During the repair/riot, the pilot surfaced every 20 min to tell us the plane would be repaired in 15 min. At one point there were probably 30 people in the aisle with their baggage trying to get off the plane, the flight staff was only able to prevent them from leaving by being bodily in their way.

I was offered a premium seat with an additional 80k. Declined and glad i did.  Before the plane took off. A group of local pax started hauling their bags to the empty premium seats. The FA didnt stop them.  When i wanted to move to two rows behind, i was told i could but had to return to my assigned seat before landing. It was one of those what the heck moments. And why didnt those who moved could remain?? This puzzled me a lot.

Other than that, the flight was on time. 60usd all inclusive with no luggage. I had neither the time nor the energy for a 2 day bus ride.

We were booked to fly HCM to Da Nang return with them. We had flights SG to HCM return with jetstar leaving 2 hours to transit between flights. The below is the experience we had with Vietjet

• vietjet moves flight leaving 40 mins to transit. On calling they will only speak to you of you call Vietnam from your Singapore number at your cost. The original flight (last flight) is cancelled. They move us to a flight at 5.30am (we book an airport hotel)
• 1 day into our trip we are sent the confirmation for the flight we already took 1 day ago
• they move our outbound flight to leave 40 mins to transit again. Reception calls (again having issues we wont use our phone) and gets us on another flight
• they cancel the new flight. 5 minutes transit time is left for us. We move the flight again
• the flight departs over an hour late. Gate changes, missing buses etc - absolute shambles. Made our next flight after jetstar kindly let us through after check in closed.

During my flight from Da Nang to Hanoi, a box that contained fish and ice, obviously melt at the baggage room,and it ended up all on my suitcase which was made of fabric.So all my clothes smelled of fish.Despite the fact that for the life of me, I cannot understand why they would let the transfer of such a box- containing sensitive food -with the rest of the baggage,when I went to the ground staff,they simply told me they would compensate and filed a report along with my contact information.I took a copy of it and waited for them to contact me while I was in Hanoi,but of course they didn't.I then flew back to Da Nang,so as to visit Hoi An (having had to pay laundry service for all of my clothes by myself plus carrying a smelly suitcase with me) and 6 days later,not a word of them still.So on my way home, I had a connection flight to HCMC,from Da Nang and went to their ground service fully aggressive to get my compensation.

What I had to endure was simply UNACCEPTABLE!I showed them the copy,they asked me twice if I demanded a compensation.When I insisted they responded something like ""ok relax,I am just asking.""First they offered me a free ticket from Da Nang to Hanoi,but obviously I declined because I am tourist,not a regular visitor.They asked me why.Seriously?Then, they were on the phone for 5 minutes and when they hung up they were like ""We contacted you via email and you never replied"" I said no you didn't.And they replied laughing ""how do you know?"".I said I know because I checked.Then they told me that their policy was to refund me around 15 dollars(admitting that way that they previously lied about sending me an email).It was this or nothing,so I took the money,the staff still buffled that I demanded to get it.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst airline ever!,"The company seems to have a quite bad reviews in Facebook and we have no choice than to agree with them and go with one star. Our connecting flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Phu Quoc island was delayed around 3,5 h without any explanations given. Funny thing was when the aircraft finally arrived to HCMC we noticed that earlier that day we had seen that same aircraft in Da Lat airport where we took our flight to HCMC and it was going to Nha Trang. It was on schedule still in Da Lat.  The only good service was that they let us drop the luggage early when the check-in wasn't officially open that we didn't have to carry our luggage all that time we had to keep on waiting.  We were still in better position since we met people who had been waiting that aircraft from the morning and we had to hang in HCMC airport only 5,5 hours.

The service in the plane wasn't anything special and the uniforms the cabin crew are wearing are quite distasteful combining red colour and brown checkered fabric. Some of them wore shorts that tried to be youthful, but none of them looked good or very professional in those outfits. 

When we finally arrived to Phu Quoc, and got the luggage I noticed that my backpack was broken. The left shoulder strap was loose. After a very slow reclamation process on the counter which included 4 different officers I got 4 € refund (100 000 VND) to get my backpack fixed somewhere because I couldn't carry it in that condition on my back.
I said to main officer that this doesn't seem to be very good or professional airline and he just nodded and smiled. It is famous of delays and overbookings according to many other reviews, so if you have limited time, I recommend you to pay few extra bucks to fly with more reliable companies like AirAsia or Jetstar or Nokair which have been very good experiences always for us. 

This Airline has started in 2011 so they still have a lot of developing to do. We won't fly with this company ever again no matter if their tickets cost 5$. We lost precious time in the beautiful island of Phu Quoc and without our amazing hotel (Praha) staff there would have been an extra trouble too of finding someone to fix my backpack.",Date of travel: May 2016,

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Poor service,"I was sitting at the exit seat. The flight attendant as a normal procedure should come and explain how to take action in case of emergency. However, when she came to me instead of conversing in English, as I am not either Korean or Vietnamese, she only talked in Korean to the person who seated besides me and she left. When we came back, after checked in, the ground operators changed the entrance gate at least four times, making all the travelers to move from one gate to another including going up to stairs to up and down. The flight attendants were showing how to use the life saving instruments during emergency, but the instruments they use was dirty and you feel disguised with it. Seating was not movable and there was no entertainment. It is just like a poor bus. Finally, when we arrived to landing the flight attendants gave us a custom declaration paper, I politely asked if they could lend me a pen, the flight attendant said with fatigue face they don't have pen and recommended me to fill it once I arrive at the terminal. making the give in advance irrelevant (Or travelers should have a pen). One strength I saw was that the landing was smooth. I felt comfortable with that. In conclusion, It might be a coincidence that I had an uncomfortable experience but I will not use the airline again.",Date of travel: March 2016,"[{'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '2.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}]"

1.0 of 5 bubbles,flight time changes of more than 12 hours cost us missed connections,"We booked flights for 6 people about 2 months in advance the flights we booked connected with flights to and from Brunei leaving about 2 hours to make connections. The Brunei flights were not part of the deal. At the last minute we got email advice that our flights had both been changed the outbound one forward by 2 hours and the return one from 8.00 in the morning to 23.50 later that night. When we tried to get hold of them on the internet we could not get a response and on looking up alteratives to the returning flight from Da Nang to Saigon we found all other airlines either fully booked for the whole day or taking routes which went round the world almost to get there. The changes meant that we had a 4 hour wait in Saigon going out and a missed connection coming back. The cost of recovering from the missed connection was much more than the cost of of the return tickets Saigon to DaNang. When they changed our flights they said the flight s had been cancelled. When we got to Saigon Airport The flight we originally booked was still going and we had been bumped due to the airline overbooking the flight. We tried at Saigon airport to get back our flights for the return trip or at least earlier ones but could only get a flight a little earlier but still missing our Brunei flights. Again the cause was overbooking and it seemed to us that a party of 6 with european names was an easier target to bump off than 4 or 5 vietnamese who had only booked days before the flights

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Very cheap but less reliable schedule,"Benefit of VietJet is the low price and good coverage of destinations in Vietnam. Plane looked to be in OK condition. 
Downsides:

• Boarding gate was changed, but this change was not communicated. 

• Schedule was delayed by 4 hours, information one day before the flight. This happened similarly already in the past. Looks like this airline changes the schedule or cancels flights often depending on the booking situation. We could however re-book our flight free of charge to limit the delay to two hours vs. the original schedule. Plane then had another hour delay (without any communication), thus arrived 3 hours after initial plan. Would thus avoid VietJet if you want to catch a connecting international flight.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrid!!,"In this day and age just how bad does an airline have to be in order qualify as “horrid”?
    You need look no farther than Vietjet Air for the answer.
    It starts with booking. I went over the fees with a fine tooth comb and even emailed the Vietjet Air so that I would know exactly what I was paying for and any extra fees that may be lurking. Only when I was satisfied that I knew what I was paying for did I book. According to the email Vietjet sent me, 1 checked bag of 30kg or less per person was included.
    We arrived at the airport over two hours ahead of time for a domestic flight. The lines were incredibly long. We wound our way through the terminal, inching our way up. Finally, it was our turn. The agent said we had to pay for checked bags. And, because we did not pay ahead of time the fees were much, much higher. No one cared about the emails I had received. We were sent to another line to pay to check bags. I paid for both ways. In fairness, the round trip fare was low and the baggage fees were far less than the US, but they had told me that checked bags were included.
    We went up to the gate to await our flight. And wait we did. The flight kept getting pushed back due to “weather”.  Weather? What weather? It was warm and sunny all along the route. Two hours later, we took off.  
    The plane had instructions in Russian and English. Every beverage and morsel of food is only available for a price ~ even water. The flight attendants were totally uninterested in the passengers and spent the hour long flight talking amongst them selves. The seats were like cardboard, and we had a very bumpy landing.
    The return flight was an exact repeat ~ except our wait this time was close to 5 hours! Again the cause was again due to “weather”.  It is common knowledge that Vietjet Air is always late, and it is always due to “weather”, especially on Fridays. Naturally, the day we were returning was a Friday.

On the Narita flight from Thailand via Hanoi, the departure and arrival times were changed from 16:00 to 19:00 to 21:00 on the same day.
I arrived in Hanoi an hour before the transfer, and it was five minutes before the departure and arrival that I finished entering and leaving.
I dashed to and from NO and arrived in time!!!

Then I thought it was unnatural that there was no sign of emitting it, and when I looked at the monitor...
Even the arrival and departure NO had changed.

When I headed back to the arrival and departure NO, it had already left, and I told the receptionist
""You're late."" I was told it was a bit of a chopstick.
I thought it was unreasonable because the arrival and departure NOs were unusual and the time was off, so it was strange! I replied, ""I'm not going to change my attitude, I'm going to get angry and leave the room. After that, it seemed that only airlines could change or leave the museum, so I reluctantly sought out other people in charge and approached them.

When I asked the receptionist for another incoming and outgoing flight, he responded with a really nasty attitude.
The flight was rescheduled for the next day and I had to stay at the airport until the next time.
(All the people I met had a sinister attitude.)

I was able to leave Hanoi the next day, but the flight was also bused to the plane, but I couldn’t get on it and turned around, delaying it for over an hour. (laughs)
I thought before we took the bus, we'd find out what was going on with the plane officer and the phone...
Too dumb ...

Later, I received an email from the airline saying that if I was more than two hours late, I might be able to claim compensation, and they asked me to do so by mail.

The request was in English and there were instructions to send the original by international mail.
I asked for confirmation of approval because it is multilingual and it is a heavy workload when it is not approved by international mail, but the answer was not a single point that could be sent.
