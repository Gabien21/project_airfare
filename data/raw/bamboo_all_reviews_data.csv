1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Used to be good, now terrible.","When this airline first started it was a very good airline. Since it has come under new managed, lead by Luong Hoai Nam, appointed on October 23, 2023, the airline declined and has terrible customer service and delays.  If you are a foreigner, expect to be charged for a name change, as they will read your first name as your middle name, due to Vietnamese passport putting middle names first on passports. Scam to make money off foreigners. Originally, VietJet were the worst Vietnamese airline, but I think Bamboo has taken that crown now. Avoid!",Date of travel: March 2025,

Came speak to customer service team on ground, asked him to point out mistake on my end as i didn’t understand why my name was wrong. He was looking through my phone for 10 minutes, couldn’t figure out why. He even asked to try booking a ticket again and show him everything. He clearly knew the mistake comes from the airline but he bluntly told me to either pay or not travel. Plus, I was at check in counter and staff couldn’t be bothered asking me if I confirmed travelling and they just closed the flight.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good in most respects, but routine scam of passengers for additional ""booking change fee""!!","Pretty much everything was fine with our 40-minute flight itself. The plane was an older A321, but clean and well maintained. Flight was on time.  Our only complaint was the same as hundreds of other passengers. They seem to routinely milk passengers for an extra 108K VND for not having middle names entered in their system exactly as appearing on passports.  This is the first airline I've ever seen scamming passengers in this manner.  It literally took the agent 15 seconds to change my name in the system, but she insisted to charge the ""booking change fee"".  The staff said many, many passengers complain about this racket.  It would be exceedingly simple to revise their booking program and include a warning on the booking site about the strictness in requiring the middle name, but they obviously don't want to eliminate this cash cow. Imagine, an extra 108K VND from half of their passengers!!

1.0 of 5 bubbles,A poor passengers experience let down by terrible IT systems,"This airline’s IT systems are terrible and cause all sorts of unnecessary problems that annoy customers and make the passenger experience an annoyance. 

We bought two return tickets with 20kg of checked luggage each. When checking in at the airport for the return journey, we were told we only have luggage allowance for one person even though we have an email confirming otherwise.

We were sent to the service desk to sort it out. There we were told we had luggage allowance for one person even though we had one booking number for the entire return trip and had paid for checked luggage for two people. So this became an argument until my partner held his ground and the agent corrected their systems.

We also had problems on the outbound journey, my partner having been told his name was too long for their system. The system had therefore shortened it but this means the name in the system was then different than what was in his passport. 

When IT systems cause you the odd problem, fine. But then your problems become routine and lead to consistent passenger annoyance, you have a big problem you need to urgently fix.",Date of travel: January 2025,

I then paid and got on the plane: I didn’t realize I had a battery pack in my bag so they came on the plane and asked me to sign a paper that they would remove the battery pack and put the luggage on my plane, I signed. When we began moving I noticed my air tag was not moving with us. I proceed to ask a flight attendant what was going on. He pulled Joseph, the manger over to figure it out. I told Joseph what she told me and was told I’m lying that she told me it would go on the next flight. Another flight attendant heard this and came over and told Joseph she in fact did tell me that it would be put on our flight. Joseph then became very apologetic and even brought us free drinks, upon landing we were told, by Joseph, they would bring my bag to the hotel I just had to go to lost and found to work it out. Upon getting to lost and found the girl working was rude and had no idea what I was talking about.

Extremely silly technicality as it is clearly me and I can provide other forms of identification. Never have I ever had this issue traveling which leads me to think this airline is scammy. And I had another incident a few days prior flying another budget Vietnamese airline where they scammed me by double charging for check in luggage. Bamboo rep said I would need to purchase another round trip ticket since they would not be able to add my middle name to the ticket.

Tickets cancelled without refund and re-claimed without refund. Bamboo Airways it basically doesn't respond and expects you to get tired and Bamboo Airways will not refund. Basically, don't buy or fly with Bamboo Airways.

Help is simple, and I am surprised by the ignorance of all the complains! Valid only if tickets were purchased through Bamboo Airways website by payment card! If not - you will not be happy! Suing in Vietnam (a small amount) is a nonsense.

Claim a refund with your bank that given you the payment credit card. You must submit documents to the bank - written correspondence (e-mails) where you request a refund and notice that the seller (Bamboo Airways) does not reply or has promised to refund the money and despite your urgent refunds and does not reply (silent)!

I complained with my bank and after about 7 weeks, my bank refunded me the full amount. Bamboo Airways did not prove to their Vietnam bank that it was not right to return the money. You have approximately 13 months from the payment to make a claim - The money is withdrawn from payment card. 

You no longer deal with the airline, but your bank deals with the airline's bank for you. The processing of this claim is subject to strict international rules of companies such as VISA or Mastercard.

They only check bags 2 hours prior to departure so we had to lug around our bags until it was time to check them in again. 3 hours roll by and we return to the counter to check our bags, they look up our confirmation number and tell us we are not on this flight. How? The lady that told us about the first delay deleted our reservation and our seats were bought out… I’m not even sure how that’s possible and we received no notification that our reservation was cancelled. There was another bamboo flight leaving at 6:30pm, unfortunately, there was only 1 seat open and there are 4 of us. We managed to be put onto another flight with a departure time of 10:30 pm.

They said they did not process refunds but recommended that I find the Bamboo Airways ticketing desk in Ho Chi Minh airport where a refund would be given. I found the Bamboo Airways desk at Ho Chi Minh and even though I could give them all documentation, emails and the mastercard for refund they refused to refund the ticket saying it wasnt their Policy to refund at that desk and I had to wait for response via email. Its been about a month now and this response has not yet come. I see via Bamboos Facebook page that they are niw wanting people to fill in a form for a refund. 

It shouldnt be this hard to get a refund for a cancelled flight. 

The flight that did run from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh was actually good. It ran on time and there was a good food and beverage service. Seats were comfortable. The plane was half empty.

We were contacted with a blank email stating the flight had been cancelled (see attached photo).

Managed to find a GB number to call, I will say the gentleman was lovely, however, he gave me an email address for the refund team, only for the email to be bounced back as an invalid address.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible service - avoid,"Booked a two week, return flight, from UK to Vietnam. Bamboo changed the return flight twice; the last change was done the day we drove to the airport ahead of our early morning flight. They ‘pulled’ our flight and bumped us to another date we couldn’t make. The new date made our trip  17/18 days long, which meant finding new accommodation and having extra food/drink costs. We also couldn’t make the new date due to work (I’m a Dr). But you can’t cancel the flight online; in fact you can’t do anything online. An hour before leaving the house I had to try calling their call centre in Vietnam. It took 6 goes to get through without being cut off. I asked for a cancellation and refund on the return element of the ticket (to book with another airline) but they insisted they wanted to put us on another flight of theirs rather than refund us. I was worried about the phone being cut off again, and I felt we were put on the spot, so we reluctantly agreed to take an earlier flight home meaning it cut 4 days off our trip. This also meant we had to rebook our internal travel (change hotels and rebook internal flights). Iv been told that because they changed our return flight before 14 days I can’t claim my additional costs or costs incurred with things I couldn’t use. I discovered afterward that if I’d have taken the later flight they’d have covered my additional costs but not for the earlier flight! So I lost 4 days of my holiday and booked things we couldn’t do, because we had to be back at a specific time.  Aside from this, you can’t even book your meal online so I had no veggie food. Ridiculous in this day and age! Hanoi airport was utter chaos, and the Bomboo desk took forever to check us in (as you can’t check in on line either!). There were other issues such as closed loos, no toilet paper, and hardly any drinks. I could go on but .... just avoid  avoid avoid.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pretty good,"I was flying to Melbourne from Hanoi in Bamboo Airways. First that flight was full so they checked our bags (they only check our bags because the flight was full, not for taking more money from passengers like budget airlines). The boarding was a bit long but I got into the plane. That day I flew the economy class. The legroom was pretty good so I give it a 9.5/10. The containing suitcase was spacious so I give it a 10/10. The flight was on time. The screen was exceptional with sensitive screen and lots of Vietnamese shows. But there are still some English shows. I give it an 8.25/10 because the map is not very detailed. The seat can recline but doesn't recline much and it isn't very comfortable. So it gets 7.75/10. I recommend you to bring a pillow if you fly long-haul trips. The airplane is a bit dirty at the corners. I think that they were rushing to prepare for the my flight. Gets 7.5/10. The restroom is very clean and neat with some air refresher. The water was working and soap is very fragant. Bamboo Airways gets full marks on restroom. The pilot speaks Engligh very fluently, so I can understand. After the plane reached its crusing altitude, they started to serve dinner. I chose some potatoes and some fishes. The food was a bit dissapointing. So the airline got a 7/10 on food. After over 9 hours of flying we landed in Melbourne ON TIME.

-Han _MEL night flight - booked business - 23rd August 23 - 19:05pm DEP 6:30 ARR +1 day
We booked business on the night flight so we could sleep and economy for the day flight

They then changed our outbound flight

-Han _MEL night flight - booked business - 23rd August 23 - 19:05pm DEP 6:30 ARR +1 day
No big deal, we get an extra days holiday!

They then changed our outbound flight again

-MEL- HAN day flight - booked economy - 7th August 23 - 22:30 DEP 05:15am ARR A NIGHT flight
-Han _MEL night flight - booked business - 23rd August 23 - 19:05pm DEP 6:30 ARR +1 day

Then without so much as an email they cancelled our inbound flight and gave us a choice of losing 3 days holidays or gaining 4 days. This was a week before we left for our holidays

-Han _MEL night flight - booked business - 28th August 23 - 8:00am DEP 20:30pm ARR

I had to ring there Vietnam office in Hanoi as I couldn't get a response from there team here in Melbourne.

I asked to change the outbound to business as it was a night flight and the inbound flight to economy as it was a day flight - was told not without a fee. Why do I have to pay a fee for their continuous messing around?

Furthermore on the business class flight they ran out of beer after 3 hours and the beef stew wasn't available as they were sold out. There were only 9 people in business class and four of them hadn't even paid full fare. The service was terrible  - if you wanted something you had to keep asking, not once was I asked if I needed anything outside of the meal times and they were miles apart - 9:30am breakfast and 4:00pm lunch/dinner, remember  this is BUSINESS class

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Downgraded Twice!!,"Booked a return comfort seat which is basically their premium economy. I’m 6ft 4 (nearly 2m) so this is needed for me. 

On both sectors I was downgraded to economy without apology.  After the first flight I emailed them to complain and they made the excuse they are a new air line. The aircraft they used that day did not have the premium cabin.  I’m willing to accept that sometimes this to happen for operational reasons. 

But a second time? They even had business class seats available but refused to upgrade me as it was not company policy. Other airlines would without hesitation. I’m even a gold member of Bamboo. 

I need to fly to Vietnam regularly but will choose other airlines in future. 

Onboard service is good. Polite and friendly cabin crew so I have them 2 star instead of 1!

We were without the luggage for the entire trip of 8 days and there was no earnest attempt made to locate and deliver our luggage in the next available flight. Instead they decided to keep the luggage in Melbourne to save them the transportation costs. In spite of several emails, I did not receive any communication until the last day of my return. For all the inconvenience and additional expenses incurred on the essentials, we were offered a paltry compensation of $60. It was more an insult than a compensation and hence, I did not accept the compensation. Apparently, that is their policy. As per Montreal convention, which Vietnam is part of, airlines are required to compensate customers for baggage delays with up to $1700 USD. They are misleading people stating that their company policy allows them to compensate up to a maximum of $30 only. They turned our holiday into a nightmare as we had to shop for essentials including basic clothes for three of us, which included a 3 year old toddler. We spent over $1700 in essentials and $60 does not even remotely make up for it. Imagine spending time shopping in an alien country with a toddler when we should have been enjoying our holiday.

Only feedback I can give was  they change our connecting flight to Phu quoc ,  that sort of need us to stay at least  11hrs in Ho Chi Min that resulted for us to stay in Ho chi min hotel near the airport.
But it was okay as we are advised of this changed 3 weeks before our flight so we are prepared.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ridiculous scam-like ""policy"". Bamboo must be short for Bamboozle","My wife booked 2 tickets for us to travel from Saigon to Hanoi on booking.com. We checked-in online without issue, but had to check-in baggage when we got to the airport. The service rep said that we could not proceed because my wife had left our middle names off the tickets and that we would have to go to another counter to correct the issue. Seemed odd to us since we have traveled without issue on other airlines when we didn't include our middle names. We got to the other counter and was told that 1) my name on my ticket didn't need to be corrected because I have a U.S. passport (my wife has a Vietnamese passport), 2) they could not correct my wife's name on her ticket because she booked through booking.com and not Bamboo directly, however, if she could show a Vietnamese ID other than her passport, they could make the change. Since my wife didn't have any other Vietnamese ID, she was told her only option was to purchase a brand new ticket, which she ended up doing.  We were then issued new tickets which were different seats than what we originally had.  We originally had seats at row 17, window and middle. They moved us to row 36 (2nd to last row), middle and aisle.

Seats didn't have the worst leg room I've experienced, but it wasn't that much better. Seats are very uncomfortable as there is minimal cushioning.

Lunch was an absolute joke. Initially, it looked like a mini-baguette-like bread that was cut in half, but it was actually, in fact, a sandwich if you can even call it that. It consisted of a hot dog that came straight out of the packaging (not heated or cooked in any sort of way), a stem of cilantro, and some measly pieces of pork/chicken floss (chà bông) (not even sure what meat it was). I would almost have preferred just a piece of bread than them passing this off as a sandwich.

Many of the passengers also seem to be those that rarely travel as they don't respect lines, personal space, or instructions given by staff. When lining up to board the plane, some older ladies literally squeezed themselves in front of us. When my wife called them out on it in Vietnamese saying that there's a line and they can't just cut in front, they just replied back in Vietnamese that ""it's no big deal"" (Có gì đâu). Passengers seated in front of us kept resting their arms/hands on top of their headrest which draped their hands onto our side resulting in us having to look at fingernails caked with dirt/oil/etc... while we were eating our embarrassment of a lunch. Passengers were repeatedly instructed to sit down while the seat belt light was on during turbulence, but they often just ignored the instructions.",Date of travel: April 2023,

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Surprised by such good service,"Recently flew Bamboo from Gatwick to Hanoi and our return leg was Saigon to Gatwick.  When the travel company we were using notified us that our airline was changing fro Vietnam Airways to Bamboo, I’ll be honest, I was not happy.  Who were Bamboo Airlines???? 

We arrived  at Gatwick and managed to upgrade to Business (never flown Business before) so was rather excited at the prospect of lots of leg room.  Even though we upgraded at the airport (so cheaper) we got lounge entry and premium security included which was good.  The lounge was just the normal No.1 lounge so nothing special there but it done the job (Club lounge was closed so don’t know if that would have been used normally).

We were given priority boarding and shown to our seats, nice touch.  

Our seats went into beds, nice sized tv, nice amenities bag (with toothbrush, hand sanitiser, eye mask etc), plenty of space and well positioned so you can’t really see anyone else. Hubby & I had seats in the centre so we could talk (just left the middle screen open).  

The service was excellent and so was the food, so much food! I had wine going out but on our return journey I had fizz (it wasn’t on offer going out).  

The beds were comfortable and I actually managed to sleep (which I’m not usually able to do) the blankets were lovely and soft and the pillow was good as well.  

I liked the space you got, I’m not 100% comfortable flying but found that not being cramped really helped.  

Our return journey (managed to upgrade again) was just as good, lounge at Saigon a bit nicer than Gatwick.

Hubby managed to leave his phone in the lounge, he told a member of the cabin crew and they got the phone back to us before take-off so very impressed with the service we received.

I’m comparing my experience to previous flights with Thai airways and Eva air. 

There was no option to select dietary requirements on booking, I had to email customer service but they got the food wrong on both flights, after the outbound flight I emailed them about the mistake, the day of the return flight they tried to tell me they need 24 hours notice and I’d have to bring my own food. I told them I emailed them multiple times with plenty of notice, I then got an email saying they would meet my requirements. 
On the plane the stewards told me there was no special meal request, even though it was confirmed at check in. Made me find the emails to ‘prove’ it then magically my food appeared. 

I like to have a couple of drinks on a long flight like that, I was given one small can of beer on the outbound flight, then when I asked for another I was told it was ‘finished’ 
Return flight no alcoholic drinks were offered to anyone. 

The seats feel smaller than normal long haul economy but maybe that’s in my head as the planes were full. 

You have no individual air conditioning controls and it was uncomfortably hot. 

The windows get closed after take off and the controls are locked so you can’t open them. Why? I like to look out the window, you just feel like you’re trapped in a hot capsule for 12 hours.

10days later, they cancelled that booking without notice. 

After contacting our credit card company- American Express and multiple emails to Bamboo headquarter in Vietnam, we got the refund from Bamboo but it was a different amount to what had been charged. Again, we had to contact AmEx to get the variance amount refunded. Ridiculous

We tried to make booking again with Bamboo, however, they had raised the ticket price, in details we had already booked 2 different business-class flights for up-coming months and this is just another flight we needed.

I was stopped from going through immigration and told to go to the transit counter.
At the transit counter, I was told, we can get your bags but we can't check you in for 7 hours (layover was 10 hours )  so you will have to  wait in the immigration hall, with no seats, no shops, just a room with 10 or so immigration desks, Upon some back and fro with the agent  They made a call and said  ok ok you only need to wait for 3 hours. Are you kidding me, I  did not pay for a self-transfer ticket nor did I poy   to stand in a hallway for 3 hours. After more time talking with the supervisor I was told ok ok we will check you in, Given a boarding pass, I said what about my bags. We will come and give you a baggage receipt later. Enter the lounge stay there for a few hours, Then told you must leave or pay 45 USD if you want to stay, So I paid as I wanted a shower and had 4 hours left on my Layover. 
The flight was ok - service standard. My advice ds not use this airline if you are a business traveler, Vietnam airlines is far better and worth the extra 200 bucks -",Date of travel: February 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

At Melbourne airport on 31/1/23  QH82,"The mobility service ( wheel chair) service offered by SWISSPORT Was below standards, as the staff abandoned my disabled daughter (16) and myself ( (arthritides sufferer ) and two trolleys of luggage half way through and disappeared without taking us to the Taxi rank just outside the Airport. 

This is bad service. I have adviced Bamboo Airways to change the ground handling agent SWISSPORT to another reputable company at the Melbourne end. 
SWISSPORT is also notorious for poor baggage handling damages/lost baggage’s which brings a bad name for the Airline

I've been travelling for 15 years and have never had an issue at check-in. The Bamboo Airways ground staff were rude from the moment I got to the counter, and told me I needed to check my carry-on bag as it was too big - this was not true, I had used this bag on many flights before, and it was the correct weight at 7kg. I asked them to measure it and they refused, and then said that my personal item (a small backpack!) had to be my carry-on, and they forced me to check my bag. 

It was clear that they were on a power trip once I got to Hanoi and saw many other bags, smaller than mine, at the baggage claim belt that were obviously meant to be carry-on (soft sports bags, backpacks etc.) - they had forced others to check their bags as well. 

They left a very sour taste in the mouth, and caused an extreme amount of anxiety and distress due to their completely unnecessary behaviour. Don't even bother complaining as Bamboo Airways will just ignore your emails, so you're better off booking with someone else.",Date of travel: December 2022,

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Very bad experience at check in at Tan son nhat airport,"Today, January 6th, 2023, my family flew from Hanoi to Sydney with Bamboo airline. My family has two people, each person can carry 45kg of luggage. First, we took flight QH 241 from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. At the check-in in Noibai airport, Bamboo's staff checked and confirmed that there was 90kg of checked baggage to Ho Chi Minh City. Then we  flew to Ho chi Minh City  and did check-in procedures in Ho Chi Minh City to take flight QH 086 to Sydney. At the check-in counter, the check-in peson said that our checked baggage was 8kg overweight and had to be paid extra, although he also admitted that the total amount of checked baggage from Hanoi was 90kg according to tags on baggaged attached by Bamboo staff in Noibai airport. This is clearly a mistake of the Bamboo airline, due to the incorrect weighing of baggage check at Noi Bai or Saigon airports, or because the staff at Noi Bai were negligent in weighing. However, when we asked to speak to the supervisor in charge, he said that we need to complain to Noi Bai airport, or not be able to board the plane, or have to pay more.
We were very surprised at the unreasonable behavior of Bamboo's staff and the supervisor in charge of check-in at Tan Son Nhat airport. They behaved irresponsibly, as if the check-in department at Noi Bai was not a unit of Bamboo. Recently, my family has used Bamboo Airways' services a few times and is quite satisfied with the quality of service provided by the airline. However, the recent incident has changed our feelings for Bamboo. It is hoped that Bamboo Airways will take timely corrective measures to avoid such phenomena, worsening the good reputation and image that the airline has worked so hard to cultivate.",Date of travel: January 2023,"[{'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}]"
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Bad customer service experience!!! Complete Fraud!!!,"As I was gifted 2 free flights from Bamboo and wanted to redeem the vouchers. At first, the vouchers displayed no expired date though there is a brand stamp on the vouchers among with the director’s signature, it also displays that the voucher is not eligible during holidays and Tet holidays. However, when I wanted to redeem the vouchers, the booking center said that the vouchers are expiring in January 31st 2023 and they won’t redeem the voucher from 29th December 2022 to 7th February 2023 due to holidays and Tet. FYI, the 2023 Tet holiday in Vietnam begins from 22nd January 2023 to 25th, and the New Year begins from the 1st to the 3rd only. I questioned the booking center if the ineligible period is the official holidays according to the Vietnamese laws (which is not), but they refused to answer and directed me to the person who gifted me the vouchers??? I mean wt*??? I sent them a couple emails afterward but they still refused to give me the answer. So to me this seems like a big airway in Vietnam is not familiar with commercial law, and their attitude tells me that they are fraud for issuing the vouchers. They do not care about their customer satisfaction. Now I have to see my valuable gifts are going to waste because they can’t properly operate their business.

I am so frustrated with their customer service department: Firstly, BA re-scheduled my flight from morning flight to afternoon flight and they gave me 2 options: whether I accept or decline the new timing. Due to my work schedule, I declined it. Then, BA ""CANCELLED my reservation"". Therefore, I could not search for my booking and make a modification. I contacted their customer service via email and received a response after 2 days. In the email, they just double confirmed that my reservation is cancelled and NO REFUND according to their policy. No solution was given. That's meant: I could not modify my booking as it is cancelled by BA and I will receive no refund. It's ridiculous.

No email communication from Bamboo Airways prior to departure (booked our flights via a travel agent) and they changed departure time less than 24h prior to departure. They are very proud of flying Boeing 787 Dreamliner but they saved on any interior features and so the seats are not comfortable, there is no individual control over air-conditioning, they lock all windows so you will not see anything outside during the whole duration of the flights. There is very very very poor choice of inflight entertainment and they have the same movies/ series on the flight London to and from Hanoi. This was the most basic Dreamliner we have ever experienced. There are no pillows for overnight flights, no eye masks or earplugs. You get the bare minimum. One alcoholic drink per person, if that, no snacks (they quickly run out of noodle instant soups and terrible sandwiches). They are unwilling to offer tea or coffee.

Security : As mentioned above , there is a separate Fast-Track for Business Class passengers , which was quite beneficial at that time of the day.

Lounge : There is a separate lounge for Bamboo Airways , with ample seating. Did not pay much attention to the F&B options available , but the lounge was plush & comfortable enough for a short stay.

Boarding : Unlike Hanoi , we did not notice / experience the ""escort-to-gate-from-lounge"" service here. At the gate / aerobridge , the ground staff genuinely treat you like a VIP , and inform the cabin crew about your arrival.

Seating / Layout : Standard Business Class seats , in 2-2 configuration. Comfortable enough , but nothing exceptional.

Service : Very professional & courteous crew.

Food & Beverage : A sandwich ( a.k.a. a snack ) , presented nicely on a tray ( despite being a morning / breakfast time flight ). The Vietnamese Iced Coffee was delightful.

Our Flight is scheduled 8.30am to depart, actual departure about 8.40am (which is normal delay for all airlines, due to normal logistics/admin checks). 
Happy that we arrived 14 minutes earlier anyway, at 12.41 pm into Singapore, (scheduled arrival was 12.55pm). 
Food is standard and fine, enough to fill you, a western fish option and an asian Chicken on Rice. Most of the service crew staff are friendly. Except one who was abit impatient trying to stop me from rearranging my luggage near taking off. One thing i noted, the toilet, is clean (i used at beginning of the flight), but the sink did not seem to drain the water well, after washing my hands. I highlighted to the service crew who told me he will fix it. 
In addition, I heard a mother with a crying baby for quite some time, seated behind me, which i thought the Service Crew could have taken initiative to come to see how they could help. 
Generally, if you want to arrive safe, punctual, at affordable price ( i paid $83 for airfare + $67 tax = Total $151 for 1 leg back via Trip.com), clean flight with basic food, yet able to have a free 20kg checked-in baggage, I highly recommend this airline !

5.0 of 5 bubbles,A true boutique airline ( Business Class ),"Check-in : Not quite ideal to be frank. We arrived late at night in Vietnam , and were expecting a baggage drop-off counter in T2 itself , but there wasn't any. When we reached T1 , the staff refused to check us in. Reason : our flight was technically departing the next day ( i.e. first flight of the day ) & departures in the domestic terminal cease for the night , thus , we were very curtly told to come 2 hours before our flight. The attitude of the staff could have easily been friendlier / more effort could have been made to explain things despite the language barrier , especially to a family of 4 foreigners flying in their Business Class. 

Security : Did not notice any separate queue for Business Class passengers , nor were we told about it at the check-in counter. But being the very first passengers of the day made all that immaterial.

Lounge : Now this is where everything took a turn for the better. Staff - FABULOUS. Food - AMAZING. Service - PAR EXCELLENCE. We were treated by the staff as if we're in their own home , and were pampered with all the local delicacies. Do try the Pho here.

Boarding : Just when we thought we've seen the best the airline could offer , came the 'luxurious' boarding experience. WOW. First , a ground staff member came to personally escort us all the way to the gate. Since our aircraft was at a remote parking bay , we got a private car to drive us down the tarmac. Once at the aircraft , the ground staff & crew treat you like a VIP , and the latter even load your luggage in the overhead bins.

Seating / Layout : The seats are pretty basic , but thankfully not the bulky kind as seen in older aircrafts. 2-2 configuration arranged in 4 rows.

Service : VERY GOOD. The crew was attentive , courteous & professional.

Food & Beverage : Not a breakfast spread. More of a snack to be honest. But , well presented. The Vietnamese cold coffee was delightful.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible service,"Bamboo Airways has been very underwhelming.

The only reason why I am giving two stars is because the plane seemed quite new and there was plenty of leg room/space.

The staff has to seriously improve especially on the ground in Ho Chi Minh City. The speed of the check in was mindblowingly slow. There were 3 counters open, one for regular economy class, one for priority boarding and one for business class. There was no customer at the business class counter with 3 of the staff waiting there. You would think they would direct individual travellers queing up at the other counters every now and then considering no one is checking into business class and they are just idle. This is standard procedure after all. But nope ... They didn't.

The women at the other counters were the slowest I have ever seen. They needed 15 minutes to check myr papers despite everything being straightforward as I had everything required. There were around 5-10 people infront of me when I arrived. It took the staff a full hour to check them in. I have no idea why it takes so long just to check some basic documents like vaccine certifactes etc.

This would be fine and understandable to some degree considering the Covid paperwork BUT none of the staff has ever shown any friendliness during the process. No ""Good morning"", no smile, nothing ... just a stone face and sealed lips. Customer service is something they must have never heard about.

The flight attendants were slightly friendlier. All we got was water and a HORRIBLE sandwhich though. Also no other food on offer like on AirAsia for example ... 

Needless to say there was also a delay of around 45 minutes...Didn't surprise me at all considering what I experienced during check in.",Date of travel: May 2022,"[{'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Cleanliness'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Check-in and boarding'}, {'Service Rating': '1.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Food and Beverage'}]"

We did everything according to the policy. It's been 4 months and they still refuse to give us our money back. First of all, their technology is terrible. The booking system doesn't allow online cancellation of ticket. In what universe do we have to manually send them an email manually writing down every single details (full name, date of birth, booking references, bank details etc)? My husband doesn't speak Vietnamese and all of their emails are written in Vietnamese so I had to write everything for him then keep forwarding emails back and forth. So much waste of time. That's even worse than a budget airline. And they keep delaying replying your email. And even when they have confirmed they will refund you it's been more than 4 months still havent received anything. We paid extra for a ticket that allow full refund if requested and here is what we got. Never book with this airline.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,"You get what you pay for, I wish we had paid more!","I really has high hopes for this airline. Their website looks encouraging and I was looking forward to flying with them. Booking was relatively easy and the price was very reasonable, thats where the positives end. 

We’d paid extra for extra legroom seats and priority boarding. Priority boarding didn’t exist and the extra legroom seats were almost immediately filled by passengers moving from their allotted standard seats. We’d have actually had more room had we moved to a now empty row near the back. Flight attendants do very little to enforce rules which gives me great concern. During the takeoff roll one passenger spoke loudly on his mobile while another got up, moved seats and lay across a row of three with no seatbelt on. Similarly the fasten seatbelt sign is neither obeyed nor enforced. Who knows what else is ignored behind the scenes. 

The refreshment service was cancelled “due to virus” and crew disappeared behind the curtains for the duration. 

Unfortunately we have another flight booked with this outfit but I’m considering writing off the ticket cost and rebooking with VN. 

I was previously pleased to see they have ambition to start flights to Europe, I’m not sure this will ever happen, how can they expect to pass muster with the EU flight safety standards? A real shame and missed opportunity for what had potential to be a great new startup.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Scam Scam Scam l!!!!,"I am really very disappointed to a pojnt where I will be seeking legal support as I feel that Bamboo Airways has been in the wrong and VERY unreasonable! I booked a flight for 3 pax Dong Hoi to Hanoi for 14 March and received a mail that the flight has been moved to 15 March late evening. Well we already booked hotel accommodation and paid for transfers as well in Hanoi in February already and could not change the flight as Bamboo did not give is the option ,when THEY changed our booked flight to another date and time , to cancel or reschedule. When I phoned the “HOTLITE” line I eventually got to a friendly gentleman , Mr Bang, and he tried to help where he could, however to no avail but did promise that they will change the flight so we could fly to Ho Chi Minh instead as we had to by now cancel all our plans for Hanoi as we would only have 6 hrs in Hanoi from a planned 2days and those 6 hours would have been from 11pm till morning so not worth flying just to sleep and then back as we had flights booked already to return to Ho Chi Minh City on the morning of 16 March. Needless to say, I received a call stating that the airline will change out tickets and we will have to pay 5 Million VND for the change! Seriously??? First they change out flights without any options to passengers and then not willing to change tickets , no refund and want to charge 5 mil VND on top of this..... sorry but this is insane. I will seek legal advice on this matter as I feel I have been robbed! It is time to let ALL travelers know that Bamboo Airways is definitely not a good option while traveling in Vietnam.

1.0 of 5 bubbles, New airline with extremely poor customer service ,"This airline only commenced in Jan 2019 and already they are not doing themselves any favor with their current front desk crew. First time flying with them, one word to describe my first impression - chaos. Absolute chaos. The staff ""directing"" the queue didn't let anyone know where to line up, she just lifted the barrier and let around 5 people go through and let us figured out ourselves which counter to line up at. Most of the counters at that point already had 4 or more people waiting. 
The staff at the check-in desk was borderline rude in his tone and the way he addressed us. For example, he asked for passport using this exact phrase ""where's passport and travel documents?"".. no pronouns- not even looking up. We conversed in Vietnamese, so really, he got no excuse of not knowing how to use basic polite phrases- especially when he is supposedly in a ""customer service"" role.
Again when he asked about luggages, ""what's this, checked in or carry on?"". 
Did this person missed basic customer service training when he started this job?
I have flown with other budget airlines before, eg., Vietjet, Jetstar, etc. and I know they're not known for their exceptional customer service but at least it's passable. This airline made me feel they have gone really backward with their approach. For a brand new airline shouldn't they be trying extra hard to win customer over with their customer service?
Next time, I'll pay the extra 1 or 2 AUD and fly with Vietjet. Gave them a try but not up to standard, even for a budget airline.

The first 3 months was impressive however today’s flight was a disappointment.

I felt short change and worst of all, I can see other non paying passenger start to take that seat when we airbound.

Unlike other trip where they do provide water and sandwich, this time around they have cut the sandwich and give every passenger just a water (similar to Vietnam airlines)

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Customer Service and Online Booking far from their 5 star claim,"Claiming to become a 5 star airline, as their goal is, their website and customer service is far behind low cost carriers like Vietjet or Jetstar.
Booking online, the system asked me twice to start over again with a ""Try again Later"".
The first payment failed.
The second attempt worked.
As their system does not keep any customer information on failed attempts but you have to go through the entire procedure again, I had to enter all pax details (5 pax) 4 times.
Which brings it to 20 instead of 5 entries.
Absolutely annoying.
I ended up doing a mistake with one of the names when the booking succeeded. I am still not sure it was me or their system (as by all the failed attempts).
So I got one ticket (lead passenger) with the wrong name.
Asking for help, I was told the change would be an amount coming to 95% of the flight fare.
I requested a cancellation fee and they told me the (highest priced economy tariff) would be non refundable.
Fair enough.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Fresh and fast developing airline,"For the first time with this new airline I flew Hanoi-Hue 5th January on an A320-200. Purchase online was easy and very clear without any hidden costs. A minor reschedule was clearly informed (and adjustable) weeks before departure. The airline is already very popular in Vietnam and grows quickly. Checked in smooth though long queues despite 10 counters were open. Had to wait some 40 Minutes to be checked in. Got offered any seat and chose an exit seat as flight was only half full. No issue with luggage like for other low cost carriers, especially the Vietjetair that troubles many passengers due to extremely strict luggage policies with several checks in airports. Onboard, 4 FAs and 2 “service attendants” easily took care of the 80 passengers. The FAs were all Turkish women while the SAs were Vietnamese and acted mainly as translators. Nice international touch. Given water, tissue, magazines. I brought my own coffee sachets to get expresso onboard. 8 business class seats were empty. Flight on time. Busgating in both ends. Extremely good value for money, paid 33 USD. Attendant were very talkative and extrovert. No IFE on board but no need as flight took only 70 Minutes. Bamboo Airways have their logos and branding everywhere onboard with nice decorations and new uniforms etc. Even the drinking water were produced, labelled and marketed by the airline. Bamboo is considered as an LCC carrier but compares at least to a 3-star legacy carrier. A meal or at least a snack would have been nice but hard to claim for the price paid.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Changed flight time without notification ,"We booked an 8am flight and went to check in. 

The flight was changed from 8am to 1:25pm with no communication from the airline via text or email. 

We were going on a halong bay cruise and at the last minute, needed to cancel this flight, find another flight and rebook transportation incurring additional costs due to their change. 

Fortunately we went to check in and found out about the change however if we didn't, we would have appeared at the airport with no flight and alternative options as all direct flights were practically sold out  

This occurred close to New Years which was even more unbelievable. 

Then we had a series of exchanges via email to get my refund. Instead of just refunding you based on the card used, you have to to confirm everything to them via email which isn't secure. 

Unprofessional, lack of communication, inefficient and not impressed. 

Additionally, they need to take security measures with  credit cards more seriously and not transmit these details over email and ensure secure confidential simple measures are enacted, e,g., just refunding passengers on the card used.

Even when we showed our fight itineraries, credit cards, business cards, other flight boarding passes under this name “Mike”  - they wouldn’t edit it - not let us board. We had to buy a completely new ticket and the worst part was we waited in several lines and watched random unempowered staff texting our information to ‘managers’ who did nothing and refused to assist.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Be more careful and give less silly answers(bonus track... Scamers at the airport) ,"On the 23rd of December we took the flight from Hanoi to Danang... Before that everything seemed to be fine although we had a few problems with our booking and check in... We tried to see it in a positive way cause the airline is new so it was fair to give them a chance.
I will describe both sides :
Nice uniforms, decent snack, clean and new aircraft.
As for the bad things now: since their system upon web check provides random seats we got seats without window. We decided to see if the plsne would be full and if not ask for a change in an empty seat to see the landing. The answer was ""yes, but you need to come to your seats for landing""... Many people were changing seats without permise and nobody said nothing... After a while we asked again explaining that our cause was to see the landing but they answered ""you should have told it earlier"" that was the silliest answer ever... Fun fact... We asked the same hostess as before... 
Secondly, in front of us there were plenty of people online during take off and landing and nobody told them to switch off their mobiles because all the hostesses were sitting during take off and landing as they are supposed to but without checking belts and mobiles so carefully... These are matters of safety and
 they should definitely be more careful!!!!!!
I would also like to inform all travelers about a scam that takes place at Danang Airport... I apologize for not having the name of the company but it was a terrible day for us... There are some people outside the arrivals that help you find taxi like for example in Doha Airport and they don't ask for money... We took the first one  and as we were on our way to the hotel asked the driver about the cost..  He answered that the cost is what the meter in front says... When we arrived he asked 10.000 plus for the service... That's considered a scam because he could have mentioned that when we asked.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Shame!!! I felt not an equal passenger as the others!!!,"My title sounds somehow a little bit heavy but i will try to explain as thoroughly as I can. For sure this flight that was done today 23rd of December ruined my mood and my whole first day in Da Nang.
I booked this flight QH 107 from Hanoi to Da Nang around 2 months ago. I checked the profile of the company and everything that has to do on the flight as to be ok and informed about anything. Althought i saw some bad reviews and knew that is a low budget company I gave a try since it was a domestic flight and all the options were more or less the same. But the things that made me choose this one was the new planes and some other very good reviews.
To let everyone know this was my 160th flight in my life and the 50th country that I visit till now and it was the first time that i felt so bad,unequal and like a stranger that was given a favour to fly.
Some bad issues started before the flight when i informed that i need to change my flight schedule as the company decided to change the time. So i loged in their site but for 2 days they didnt let me to change my option. After several messages and calls which are not cheap from my country finally they change it.
Their check in is very primitive as it took a lot of time to check the already checked in tickets and to pass the luggage.
I skipped all of these in my mind and when we entered with my girlfriend we were so happy and surprised of the new type of aircraft, the spacious legroom, the beautiful dressing of the flight attendants and ofcourse the snack in so small flight. But from here starts all the bad things...
First of all to mention that we were placed in a row without any window due to random web check in which not allow you to change seat although when we entered we realised that there were about 30 seats available and many of them whole rows with windows. Now it comes the great moment. I noticed many locals (which i want to mention were in social media during take off and landing and noone tell them anything, came inside the aircraft with beers and juices etc) and ofcourse changing seats either by themselves or others asking the flight attendants. I didnt see anyone to be stopped to change seat. I have also changed seats in many flights if there are free.
So i kindly also asked if i can change seat in order to have window. The answer I received by word is yes you can change but during landing you need to come back to your seat. Sounds very weird and never heard this again. All the others that changed seats didnt returned to their previous seats during landing.
Before we start the procedure of landing I asked again kindly if i can change seat as to see the landing. The answer that I received was no you can not and when i say that many changed before me she responded that you should have done it before. But I ask to do it and the answer was weird as I wrote. Maybe because I am a tourist.
To sum on and sorry for the long review, this behaviour ruined the excellent review I was ready to write, I will definitely not use this company again and I strongly recommend anyone not even thing to travel.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pleasant but inconsistent experience,"We booked a round trip HAN-SGN-DAD-HAN for three people in Business and were happy overall despite several areas can be improved.
The Good:
1. The Business counters were ready to accept us at all airports without any wait etc.
2. The best experience was at HAN check-in: we were escorted all the ways from the check-in desk, (Priority) security, Lounge, gate and aircraft. Wonderful! This could be very useful for people who are not familiar with navigating around the airports!
3. The HAN lounge (Song Hong) was the best comparing to the ones at SGN or DAD. Song Hong lounge had good selections of foods, snacks and beverages despite our departure in the early morning.
4. All staff were very polite and professional with good grasp of English.

Things can be improved:
1. Our outbound flight (HAN-SGN) was originally due to depart around midday but changed at less than 24 hours with the reason that the flight was cancelled.We were re-booked to the earliest flight (around 6:00AM) of the same day. Later on we found out that the original flight was not canceled and that led us to believe someones more important wanted to fly midday and we were moved to accommodate the change!
2. We were quite lucky to use an agent to handle all logistic as opposed to do that directly with the airlines. It was quite a challenge to find relevant information from Bamboo's website or contact - we were not able to find details but able to obtain the information from our booking agent! We were not able to check in online despite attempts to do that for every leg - The website always returned error to the effect that the information was invalid! it appeared it was only possible to check in at an airport counter.
3. The check-in experience at HAN was an excellent exception: no escorts at SGN nor DAD! At SGN we were not able to check in due to we were 3 hour 20 minutes before departure time despite contacting the helpdesk at the airport - we were told that the system were not ready then.

I came to airport 5 hours early want to go to district 1 for a emergency matter, I showed my booking and asked the ticket office staff at the airport to leave keep my baggage for an hour, straight away refused.In my previous complain to the airline requested to introduce something for vegetarian or fish for those who do not eat meat, it seems totally ignored the request.

3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Airport and inflight crews awesome!
The onine experiece offers so opportunites for improvement.","When I booked on line I chose to see the Bamboo Airways site in English. Challenge #1: as.I was working through the booking flow the site would revert to Vietnamese.
#2: Got to the payment page and after trying several credit cards (I pay them off monthly so I knew the cards were good to go) and having my payment rejected, I was baffled.  This necessitated a trip to the QH ticket office.  Again, great effficient staff. During my visit I learned that QH does not accept credit cards issued outside of Viet Nam for online payment (no mention online of this restriction--talk about transaction friction!) The ticket office accepts cash and credit cards (except American Express-contrary to what is indicated on their site).  Epilogue:when I returned to Hanoi I signed up for the QH loyalty program (something you can suuposedly do online-it doesnt work). I now get all my program related correspondance in Vietnamese...a language I do not undetstand.

Would I fly QH again? Yes, without hesitation.  However, be warned this is a Vietnamese centric start up airline so you are likely to experience some obstacles that will be comfusing for sometime flyers and frustrating for seasoned travelers.

We were forced to pay extra for our luggage because they could not retrieve our itinerary in the system. They said that there was only one solution: pay extra. Only on the e ticket receipt and email 20kg checked in luggage was allowed.

1.0 of 5 bubbles,Constant delays with dishonest answers,"On the morning of 11 August, I was informed that my Bamboo airlines flight at 8:00PM Gad been changed to 10:50PM, When I telephoned the airline to ask about that, they said it was due to bad weather.

I am a maritime expert, and was a private pilot for 3 years. I checked to Da Nang and Hanoi weather (as I do for voyage and flight planning) and there was no bad weather, forecast for this day. Additionally, I checked vietnam Airlines, Vietjet, and JetStar, and none of them had any delays due to weather for their flights departing Da Nang for Hanoi, that evening. 

When I called Bamboo, they said it was for weather and safety. Additionally, I learned that the airline will refund money for flights departing 3 hours or more, past their scheduled departure time (they made sure that the flight would depart 2 hours and 50 minutes late; too convenient for them). 

This is the worst customer service and worst bad excuse, I have encountered in the airline business, and I have flown extensively, to 111 countries!! Other airlines flying the same route, had system-operations delays for those Departure and arrival slots on that route; no weather delays.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,First time flying with bamboo airways,"The flight was alright. It was 20mins delayed. We were given a sandwich and bottle of water during flight. When we touched down, the plane was too shaky and rough that even some people woke up from it. It was not smooth at all. 

Staffs were from Vietnam and other countries like India but they were helpful and nice. 

My flight schedule was changed from 10pm to 4pm but I didn't find it suitable for me so I had to cancel it. And yes, I got my refund back after 2 weeks. 

Lastly, I kinda find the website or the online system still need to be improved especially as I did the online check-in and I missed out to print my boarding pass so I tried to go back and go to  manage my booking to get a copy of it again but 
I couldn't. 

And once the seat is set after the online check-in, it's fixed and cannot be adjusted anymore. 

Well, overall, it was a nice flight with Bamboo airways.",Date of travel: June 2019,"[{'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Legroom'}, {'Service Rating': '4.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Seat comfort'}, {'Service Rating': '3.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'In-flight Entertainment'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Customer service'}, {'Service Rating': '5.0 of 5 bubbles', 'Service Info': 'Value for money'}]"
